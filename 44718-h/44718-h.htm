<p class="break p4 center xx-large">THE EXILES OF FALOO</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Overhead a blue sky without a cloud;
in the distance the sound of the surf&mdash;a
muffled bass which broke on the tink of the
bell at the French Mission or the scream of
the parrot on the broad verandah of the
Exiles’ Club.</p>

<p>On the lawn in front of the verandah two
natives had just finished their reluctant work
with the mower. They wore loin-cloths of
tappa and nothing else. The head-gardener
wore a loin-cloth of tappa and a white evening-dress
waistcoat, the latter being the gift of
Dr Soames Pryce. The waistcoat was
splendid but unclean. The head-gardener
had been inspecting the work of the others
from a recumbent position. All three passed
away now along the grass path under the
laden orange trees. Two gorgeous butterflies
chased one another over the lawn in the
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The plaited blind in front of the French
windows was pushed back and Sir John Sweetling
appeared on the verandah. He was a
man of fifty-five, six feet in height and inclined
to corpulence. On the whole a handsome
man, with a short white beard and moustache
neatly trimmed, and fearless blue eyes under
shaggy white brows. The nose was perhaps
a trifle nosey. He wore a white silk shirt,
white ducks, a brown holland jacket and a
panama of the finest texture.</p>

<p>Sir John lingered for a moment beside the
parrot’s perch. He scratched the bird’s neck,
and said in an affectionate voice, “Poor old
Polly.”</p>

<p>The parrot bent down and got to work with
its beak on the perch, much as if the perch
had been a steel and the beak a carving-knife
which it was trying to sharpen. Then it sat
up, drew its indecent lids over its solemn eyes
once or twice, and spoke distinctly.</p>

<p>“You damned thief,” said the parrot.</p>

<p>It was an observation which had been addressed
to Sir John before, and not only by
parrots.</p>

<p>Sir John shook his head. “Naughty bird,”
he said, “naughty bird!” Then he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
down the steps of the verandah on to the
lawn. Three lounge chairs were grouped
about a small table, and Sir John took the
most comfortable of the three. On the table
were books of a ledger-like appearance, writing
materials, and a bell. Sir John struck
the bell with a fat brown forefinger.</p>

<p>The head-gardener came out from the
orange trees. After all, he was not only the
head-gardener. He smiled ingratiatingly, as
if to say that he took a personal interest in
Sir John, and it would be a positive pleasure
to him to do anything for him. From a
natural friendliness, which only broke down
under severe stress, all the natives wore this air
of interest in the white man and of readiness to
serve them in any way. As a matter of fact
no native, with the solitary exception of King
Smith, ever did anything that he could possibly
avoid. The climate is relaxing, and the cokernut
palm supplies many wants.</p>

<p>Sir John looked at the man doubtfully.
“Well, yes, you’ll do,” he said. “Go and
tell Thomas that I want a lime-squash, no
sugar, and a double Hollands in it.”</p>

<p>The head-gardener repeated the order, with
a careworn look beginning to gather on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
handsome, dusky face. The club-house was
at least twenty yards away, and he would
have to walk every step of it. He walked
very gracefully and very slowly, a slight wind
fluttering the buckle straps of his waistcoat
behind. On the verandah he paused to rest
and to tease the parrot.</p>

<p>“Get on, you dog,” shouted Sir John. And
the head-gardener got on.</p>

<p>Presently Thomas appeared with the drink.
At one time he had been desk-waiter at the
Cabinet Club, London. At the Exiles’ Club,
in this very tiny and remote island, he was a
combination of steward and head-waiter. He
wore black trousers and neck-tie and a white
jacket. He was grey-haired, round-faced, and
loose-mouthed.</p>

<p>Sir John let the ice clink musically against
the glass. It was almost the only æsthetic
pleasure that he enjoyed. He took a long
suck at a couple of straws and then, as he
fumbled for his money, said plaintively:</p>

<p>“I say, Thomas, aren’t they coming?”</p>

<p>“Coming directly, sir. The green lizard
won, and they are not racing again, Mr
Bassett having no more ready money with
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Childish&mdash;utterly childish,” said Sir John,
irritably.</p>

<p>“Your change, sir?”</p>

<p>“It was half-a-crown I gave you.”</p>

<p>“I took it for a florin,” said Thomas, quite
unembarrassed. “My mistake. Sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>Down the steps of the verandah towards
Sir John came Mr Bassett and Dr Soames
Pryce. Mr Bassett was a very short man.
His face was ape-like and had a fringe beard
of sandy grey. He was overshadowed by an
immense Terai felt hat, and was a quaint
figure until you got used to him. He occupied
the honorary position of secretary to the
Exiles’ Club. Dr Soames Pryce was a man of
medium height and magnificent figure&mdash;a
chest deep and broad, small waist and hips,
powerful muscles, and no spare flesh. He was
clean-shaven, and his ugly, strong face suggested
a cynical Napoleon. He wore a shirt
and trousers of white flannel and a pith
helmet.</p>

<p>“My lizard won, Sweetling,” he said, as he
sank into one of the lounge chairs.</p>

<p>“So Thomas has been telling me,” said Sir
John, reflectively. “Wish I’d backed it.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Bassett,” said the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sharply. “You were grumbling&mdash;said you’d
never seen your browny run so badly. I’ll
back my green one against him once more for
another sovereign&mdash;run it off to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Can’t,” said Bassett. “Killed mine&mdash;always
kill losers.” His manner was jerky
and nervous. He was already turning over
the volumes on the table. “We have business
of some importance to the club before
us this morning&mdash;the election <span class="lock">of&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>He stopped short as a native waiter approached
with a tray. The doctor apparently
shared the taste of Sir John in morning beverages;
Mr Bassett drank iced barley-water
with a slice of lemon in it.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Sir John as the waiter
retired. “Mr Bassett is right; business of
very serious importance. We must be getting
on. I will ask Mr Bassett to read the minutes
of the last meeting.”</p>

<p>Mr Bassett jerked rapidly through the data
of the meeting and the names of the committee-men
who attended. In addition to
the names of those now present the name of the
Rev. Cyril Mast was read.</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce took his mouth away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
from a drinking-straw to observe, “Mast not
coming to-day?”</p>

<p>“I shall have something to say presently
as to that,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Myself also,” said Mr Bassett, and went
on with the minutes in a quick staccato.</p>

<p>There were certain financial matters “examined
and found correct.” There was a
history of two backed bills; in one case the
secretary would write and express regrets;
in the other the committee had found that the
price charged for giant asparagus was not unreasonable.</p>

<p>Sir John took the formal vote that he should
sign the minutes as correct, and proceeded to
routine business. Financial questions were
considered with care, and were a little complicated
by the use of more than one currency.
The club was in a very satisfactory position.
It had only thirty-two members, but the
subscription was high and the expenses were
small.</p>

<p>At last came the important business. Sir
John opened the candidates’ book and spoke
with a voice of deliberate impartiality:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we have a candidate up for
election. He is a native of this island, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to us all, I think, as King Smith. I see that
he is described here as John Smith, trader and
chief of Faloo. He is proposed by Mr Page
and seconded by the Rev. Cyril Mast. He is
supported by Mr Bassett, Mr Mandelbaum,
Mr Duncombe, Mr Clarence Mills, and Lord
Charles Baringstoke&mdash;under ordinary circumstances,
I should say a strong list. Before
proceeding to discussion I will ask our secretary
to read the letters of the proposer and the
seconder.”</p>

<p>The letters were unusually long and apologetic,
but this was the first time that a native
had been proposed for membership of the
Exiles’ Club.</p>

<p>Mr Page, in his letter, pointed out that this
was no ordinary native. He was of the blood
royal, and was recognised by all the natives
as chief or King of Faloo. It was to be remembered
that certainly in the old days and in a
neighbouring group of the islands white men
had not thought it beneath their dignity to take
positions&mdash;and even subordinate positions&mdash;at
the court of native kings and queens.</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce gave a short contemptuous
laugh; Mr Bassett glared at him out of
mean eyes and continued the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Page pointed out further that Smith had
shown a readiness to absorb European ideas
which was without parallel in the case of
a native. His business, in which a syndicate
of members of the club were financially interested,
was solid and progressive. He had
shown enterprise and talent for organisation.
He spoke French well and English to perfection.
He had been of great assistance to the
white men on the island. “And of his wide
and generous hospitality most of us have had
pleasant experience.”</p>

<p>“Good letter,” commented the doctor,
briefly.</p>

<p>The letter of the Rev. Cyril Mast repeated
much that Mr Page had said, but contained
some additional items of information. As regards
the name of John Smith, Smith was merely
the Anglicised form of its owner’s native name.</p>

<p>The doctor’s laugh was perhaps excusable.
The native name was of four syllables, began
with “m,” ended with “oo,” and had a “k”
in it. The laugh was repeated when the Rev.
Cyril Mast asserted that Smith had received
the name John upon baptism into the Church
of England, performed during boyhood when
on a visit to another island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Name,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Order,” said Sir John. “We can discuss
the letter afterwards.”</p>

<p>“I presume,” said Mr Bassett, savagely,
“that Dr Pryce does not venture to question
the veracity of a member of the club.”</p>

<p>“Rot,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Order, order,” said Sir John. “Read on,
please, Mr Bassett.”</p>

<p>He read on. The Rev. Cyril Mast pointed
out that King Smith’s attitude in religious
matters was one of the broadest toleration,
as exemplified by the fact that he permitted
the French Catholic mission on his island. He
had lessened the superstitious observances
of the natives, had deported the priests, and
now held solely in his own person the important
power of “taboo.” In view of labour difficulties
and other difficulties with the natives
it was imperatively necessary to conciliate the
possessor of this power. It was hardly too
much to say that their existence depended
upon it. It would be necessary to elect King
Smith, “even if he were not the genial, open-handed
sportsman whom we all know him to
be.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. It was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the President to speak first. Sir John spoke
with ease and fluency. He had addressed
many meetings, and soothed for the time many
angry shareholders.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” said Sir John, “Mr
Smith comes before you under very good
auspices. He is seconded by one member of
the committee and underwritten by another.
Among his supporters we have noted the names
of Lord Charles Baringstoke and&mdash;er&mdash;others.
But it must be remarked that his seconder is
not here this morning to speak for him. Why
is he not here?”</p>

<p>“He was so very drunk last night,” said Dr
Soames Pryce. There was not the least shade
of moral accusation in his voice; it was a
plain statement of a cause having a certain
effect.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” snapped Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>“I assure you, my diagnosis is correct.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” said Sir John, in mild
protest. Both men apologised to the President
for the interruption. He continued:</p>

<p>“From whatever cause it arises it is at
least unfortunate that Mr Mast is not here;
there are questions that I should have felt
it my duty, unpleasant though it might be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to put to him. However, we will leave him
and consider the candidature of Mr Smith.”</p>

<p>Here Sir John paused to light a cigar and
refresh himself from the glass before him.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, I think if I may claim
any virtue at all it is the virtue of foresight.
When the circumstances arose which made it
advisable for me to leave England, I had
already foreseen those circumstances and I
knew that Faloo was the place. From its
want of an accessible harbour, its small size,
and its position out of the usual line of trading
and other vessels, and also perhaps from a
pardonable ignorance, Faloo has been omitted
by statesmen and their advisers from treaties
innumerable. It has independence on sufferance.
Any European power that claimed
Faloo would be met by a counter-claim from
another power, and at present it is considered
too obscure and insignificant for diplomacy,
or for sterner methods of arbitration. Briefly,
it is not worth fighting about. But I know
that you will agree with me that it is just what
we require. Life is soft and easy, and the
climate is always summer. Nature has
showered her gifts upon this island&mdash;gorgeous
flowers and luscious fruits, the graceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
useful palm, the orange trees in the shade of
which we sit.”</p>

<p>“Pardon the correction,” said Dr Soames
Pryce. “The orange trees were brought by
Smith’s grandfather from Tahiti, and they
were not indigenous even there.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dr Pryce. At least I may say
that this kindly and prolific soil has, in the
case of the orange trees as in our own case,
welcomed the stranger. The natives are
friendly&mdash;except in some cases which I can
explain&mdash;and though their natural laziness
makes it difficult to find useful and trustworthy
servants, we have managed to get
along so far by a temperate firmness on our
part. For such hostility as exists I regret to
say that certain members of this club have
only themselves to thank, and I may add in
confidence that Mr Mast is one of the worst
offenders. This&mdash;er&mdash;philandering with the
wives and daughters of natives is a thing that
must definitely be stopped or there will be
awful trouble.”</p>

<p>Sir John paused for another sip, and surveyed
his companions. Dr Soames Pryce
looked straight down his nose; Mr Bassett
toyed innocently with a pen-holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, to make a long story
short, insignificant little Faloo precisely suits
me. Personally, I ask nothing better than
that I may live the rest of my life here, enjoying&mdash;if
you find some worthier <span class="lock">President&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said the other two men.</p>

<p>“Well, enjoying at least my membership
of the Exiles’ Club. Now I do not want to
break a tacit understanding by referring to the
past history of any of us. Some may have
made mistakes, or yielded to some unfortunate
impulse; some&mdash;my own is a case in point&mdash;may
be the victims of conspiracy on the one
part and misunderstanding on another. But
in any case, if ever we had to leave Faloo,
where could we go? I know of no place from
which we should not promptly be sent back
to our native land, to be tried by some clumsy
tribunal that on half the facts of the case
judges a man’s isolated acts apart from his
motives and his general character and his
mode of life.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear,” said Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>“Now comes my point. Our safety lies in
the obscurity and insignificance of Faloo.
Make it of importance&mdash;get it talked about&mdash;and
we are lost. Now Smith’s great idea is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to boom Faloo, to extend his own trade indefinitely,
and he even has dreams of finally
getting its independence formally acknowledged.
This last he will probably never do,
because the island would be annexed, but if he
did, part of the price of independence would
be an extradition treaty. He has been described
as enterprising, and the description
is true. He even now has a plan for blasting
the reef and throwing open the harbour for
his own trading ships. He speaks often of the
loss and the danger occasioned by loading and
unloading by canoes a vessel lying outside the
reef. Well, there is only room for a canoe
or a small boat to get through the reef now,
and there will never be any more room, so long
as we have the whip-hand of Mr Smith. His
interests and ours are diametrically opposed.
How can we admit such a man to terms of
perfect equality as would be implied by membership
of this club? Why should he ask it
except as a means to push his schemes with
injudicious members, lured by the prospect of
a money advantage? What would it profit us,
gentlemen, if we gained all the money in the
world and lost&mdash;er&mdash;this quiet retreat from the
malicious people who are anxious to interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with us? Believe me, he has no love for
the white man. If he permits the French
Mission it is because the French Mission is a
regular and lucrative customer and the priests
help to educate him. He is genial and hospitable;
but we also are regular and lucrative
customers and much more than that. He
has been of service to us; two or three times
he has sent off, with almost needless brutality,
low-class English and Americans, without a
five-pound note to call their own, who have
attempted to establish themselves here. He
serves us, because we do not want that type.
But he serves himself too, for they are no use
to him either. I have known Smith longer
than any white man on this island, and I know
that extension of trade and the making of
money is his first aim. He’d like a regular
trading fleet instead of the ramshackle tramps
he owns at present. When I came here he
lived in a leaf-thatched shanty and had hardly
anything. See how far he has got on already;
he means to go twenty times as far as that.
And when he’s got the money he’s on to
something else&mdash;he doesn’t talk about it, and
I don’t know much about it, but I do know
that it will be something with King Smith in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and ourselves outside. Now at present we’ve
got the whip-hand of that gentleman, and
we’ve got to keep it. We’ve got the whip-hand,
because the money on which his business
is run is our money and under our own control.
I have put seven hundred golden sovereigns
into it, Dr Pryce has two hundred, Mr Bassett
two hundred, and other members have smaller
sums, making fifteen hundred in all. From the
very beginning I took the line that (in the
absence of ordinary legal safeguards) the
borrower must trust the lender and the lender
must trust nobody. We see such books as he
keeps; we practically control the bank. We
know what he’s doing. We can say ‘go on’
and we can say ‘stop.’ Smith controls the
natives? He does. He can enforce the
‘taboo’? He can. And what on earth does
it matter so long as we control Smith? It’s
money that talks. And that reminds me
that I’ve been doing a lot of talking myself,
though I’ve still got one more point to raise.
You don’t mind?”</p>

<p>“I want to hear everything you’ve got
against Smith; it’ll help me to show the other
side,” said Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>“My own mind is still open,” said Dr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Soames Pryce. “Let me hear you both by
all means. At present it doesn’t seem to me
to matter a curse whether we elect him or not.
But might I suggest an interlude?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Sir John. “The same
idea had just occurred to me.” He struck
the bell repeatedly, until Thomas appeared
on the verandah. A sign gave the order, and
fresh drinks were brought out.</p>

<p>“Now for my last point,” said Sir John.
“England has not treated me well, and it
would probably treat me worse if it could get
me, but I can never forget that I am an
Englishman. We white men here”&mdash;his
voice vibrated&mdash;“are the representatives of
the conquering races.”</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce concealed a smile.</p>

<p>“We have a certain amount of prestige
among the natives, and we cannot give away
prestige and keep it. Our action in electing
Mr Smith would be read by the natives as a
concession made from fear. He would be
exalted, and we should be debased. A rule
of the club prohibits the introduction of any
native as a guest; I have not the least doubt
that the election of a native would also have
been prohibited, had it ever been supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that such an event was possible. Let us treat
Mr Smith with kindness and civility. He likes
to exercise hospitality, and I sometimes look
in at his place and take a drink with him.
But we must not elect him as an equal. If
you two gentlemen are divided in your opinions
my casting vote goes against Mr Smith.”</p>

<p>Sir John leaned back in his chair, removed
his hat and mopped his bald head with his
handkerchief. He was convinced that the
election of Smith would be disastrous, and he
had done his best to prevent it. Bassett, he
knew, would support Smith, but Sir John
counted on opposition from the doctor.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mr Bassett,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>But Mr Bassett suddenly adopted a conciliatory
and even flattering attitude towards
Dr Soames Pryce.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” he said. “Better take
things in their order of importance. Dr
Pryce&mdash;most popular and representative&mdash;better
hear him first.”</p>

<p>“My mind’s still open,” said Dr Pryce.
“Sir John’s been talking rather as if the
Exiles’ Club were the Athenæum and King
Smith were a doubtful archdeacon. We aren’t
the Athenæum. We represent the dead-beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
section of the conquering races. As we have
referred to the past I may mention that we
comprise men who have had to skip and can’t
go back.”</p>

<p>“A little too strongly put,” said Sir
John.</p>

<p>“I’m only saying what you’ve been thinking,”
said Dr Pryce. “Poor old Thomas
messed his accounts at the Cabinet Club and he
had to skip, and it’s supposed to be the same
all the way up through the members. All we
ask about a white candidate is how much he
brought with him or can have sent out to him.
If he can afford it he’s a member. Our rules
are easy, but we don’t change members’
cheques, and it’s a recognised principle with us
that we believe in the money we see and in no
other money. If the cash isn’t on the table
there’s no bet. That being so, ought we to
put on side? Can we carry it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Hear hear!” said Mr
Bassett with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Sir John says we’ve got the whip-hand of
King Smith now. True. So we have. So
we shall still have if he’s made a member.
Sir John thinks that if Smith opens the harbour
and widens the trade the island will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
grabbed and we shall be grabbed too. I should
say rats!”</p>

<p>“Really?” said Sir John, frigidly.</p>

<p>“I mean, with all respect, that there’s
not enough in Faloo to make any power restless
in its sleep&mdash;except ourselves, and it is not
likely to be known that we are here. As for
Smith himself, he’s a clever blackguard, but
I doubt if he’s as deep as our President thinks.
There are good streaks about him. The
natives get none of the filth that he brews in
the still at the back of his office&mdash;that’s traded
away under the rose to other islands. He’s
got an open hand, and keeps good whisky,
and what persuaded our reverend friend Mast
to get tight on curaçoa last night beats me
altogether. What I don’t like is that while
his business is financed by some of us he’s
lending money out of his share of the profits
to others. Three of the men who underwrote
him have got an advance on their remittances
from him&mdash;Charley Baringstoke’s one of them.
That might make awkwardness. He’s playing
it all out for John Smith too, as our
President says. Well, I’m playing it for Dr
Pryce. If Bassett isn’t playing it for a man
whose name begins with B I’m wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Fire in, Bassett. As I say, my mind’s still
open.”</p>

<p>Mr Bassett spoke briefly and nervously,
with a sickly, ingratiating smile, fingering at
times that uncomely fringe of beard. He was
sure that Sir John had presented the arguments
on his side of the question with great
skill and power. But he must confess that he
thought the greater part of those arguments
had already been fully answered in a few
sentences by Dr Pryce. As for the absence
of the Rev. Cyril Mast, that was really due
to delicacy and good feeling; he had felt that
the discussion of a candidate whom he had
seconded could be more free and open in the
seconder’s absence. That being so, Mast
might possibly have felt free to indulge last
night in the&mdash;er&mdash;lapse which Dr Pryce had
described. Certainly, the money-lending to
which Dr Pryce had objected was a serious
point. But he believed that Mr Smith
had only given way from good-nature,
only in a few cases, and only for small
sums. He would guarantee that an expression
of opinion would be enough to stop
it. There was one matter with which Dr
Pryce had not dealt, and that was the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
question. Here Mr Bassett became very
impressive.</p>

<p>“It’s not foreign powers and extradition
treaties we’ve got to fear. If John Smith
wants to blast the reef, and can give us
twenty per cent. for our money instead of ten,
let him do it, and I’ve got more money waiting
for him. But we’ve got to fear the natives
of this island here and now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s necessary for you to be in a
funk of something,” said Mr Soames Pryce.</p>

<p>“Order,” said Sir John. “Really, that’s
rather an insulting remark.”</p>

<p>“Sorry. I withdraw it,” said Pryce,
placidly.</p>

<p>“Sir John himself said that unless this&mdash;er&mdash;interference
with the native women were
stopped there would be awful trouble. Mr
Mast’s name has been mentioned. Two
nights ago, as he was coming home from
Smith’s, a spear went too near him to be
pleasant. Doesn’t that mean something to
fear? Let me ask Dr Pryce if he were managing
an insurance office if he would accept
Mast’s life?”</p>

<p>“If I were the physician he’d never get as
far as the manager,” said the doctor, grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mast’s is not the only case. Mr Mandelbaum
has had stones thrown at him. Lord
Charles Baringstoke has been threatened.
Natives have been found skulking round the
club-house at night. Sir John says that this&mdash;er&mdash;philandering
must be stopped absolutely.
But nature is stronger than Sir John; the
women are said to be attractive, and young
men won’t live ascetic lives. Even if it could
be stopped now, much of the harm is done
already. The election of Mr Smith would
bring the natives round again, and in the
meantime something could be done to regularise
the situation&mdash;some form of marriage
which would satisfy native susceptibilities
without imposing too onerous an obligation
upon us. The help of Mr Smith in a matter of
the kind would be invaluable. If we refuse
to elect him the natives will get to hear of it&mdash;they
get to hear of everything&mdash;and we
stand a good chance of being burned in our
beds. I don’t say we might elect Mr Smith&mdash;I
say that for our own safety we must elect him.”</p>

<p>As Mr Bassett finished there was a sound a
little like distant applause; it was merely the
club parrot stropping his beak on his perch
with furious energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will proceed to vote, gentlemen,” said
Sir John. “You know which way my casting
vote will go if there is any difference of
opinion between you.”</p>

<p>“You damned thief!” screamed the parrot.</p>

<p>“I shall certainly vote that Mr Smith be
elected,” said Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>“You damned thief!” screamed the parrot
again.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m quite decided now,” said Dr
Pryce.</p>

<p>“You damned thief!” shrieked the parrot
once more. Sir John banged the bell again
and again.</p>

<p>“Thomas!” he shouted, “take that infernal
bird inside. We can’t hear ourselves
speak. Now,” he added more suavely, “we
are ready for your vote, Dr Pryce, and the
election turns on it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Mr Bassett had made the commonest
mistake of political speakers; he
had supposed that the argument which appealed
most strongly to himself would appeal
most strongly to his audience. He had
appealed to fear. Dr Soames Pryce was not
a timid man, and he resented what he regarded
as an attempt to scare him.</p>

<p>“I vote against the election of Mr Smith
to this club,” said Dr Pryce, bluntly.</p>

<p>“After all you have said?” exclaimed Mr
Bassett. “You surprise me very much.”</p>

<p>“One moment, Mr Bassett,” said the
President. “I must declare then that Mr
John Smith is not elected.”</p>

<p>Mr Bassett paused with the pen in his
hand. “Am I to write ‘not elected,’ gentlemen?
We have all admitted that Smith is
a good, hospitable fellow, and we have business
dealings with him. We might let him down
as easily as possible. May I write ‘postponed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
for further consideration’? It commits us
to nothing, and it’s not quite so harsh.”</p>

<p>“I see no objection to that,” said Sir John.
“What do you think, doctor?”</p>

<p>“No objection,” said Dr Soames Pryce
with a yawn.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Sir John, as he rose, “I think
that concludes our business.”</p>

<p>The head-gardener and his two assistants
made an incautious appearance, and were at
once commanded to carry the club-books
within to the secretary’s room. Mr Bassett
said he supposed he ought to go and see how
poor Cyril Mast was getting on after last
night.</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce watched Bassett’s little
figure under the big hat retreating down the
avenue.</p>

<p>“Nice specimen of Pusillanimus Ambulans,
or the Walking Toadstool,” said Dr Pryce.
“What’s next, Sweetling? I don’t mind
backing my green lizard against the clock.”</p>

<p>“Silly game, very silly,” said Sir John.
“Still, I may as well lose four half-crowns at
that as anything else. And”&mdash;he glanced
at his elaborate presentation watch&mdash;“there’s
still half an hour before lunch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The course for lizard-racing had been
designed and laid out by Dr Pryce in the
courtyard on the further side of the club.
The course was circular, and the boards on
either side sloped inwards so that the lizards
should not climb them. A lizard attempting
escape would go straight ahead by the only
path open to it, round and round the circle.
That was the rule, but there were various
exceptions.</p>

<p>Dr Pryce produced the box of plaited grass
in which his lizard was kept, and turned it
out on to the course. It made an ineffectual
attempt to climb the side, and then went
straight away, looking rather like a clever
clockwork toy.</p>

<p>“Lay you ten shillings it doesn’t go round
in thirty-six seconds,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Thirty-four’s record. Not good enough.
I’ll back him to do two rounds in seventy-five
for the same money.”</p>

<p>“Done. Start the watch.”</p>

<p>Both men put down their money and kept
one eye on the stop-watch and one on the
starting-point. The lizard was round in 35.5
and going strongly. A few feet further on it
paused as if it were saying to itself, “Let’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
see&mdash;where did I put my umbrella?” Then
it turned right round and went back, presumably,
to fetch it.</p>

<p>“Damn,” said Dr Pryce, and put the
lizard tenderly back in its box again.</p>

<p>Sir John laughed and slipped the two half-sovereigns
into his waistcoat pocket. “Want
another?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No thanks,” said the doctor. “My
beast’s got into one of his absent-minded
moods. He’s like that sometimes. He might
beat the record, or he might go to sleep in the
first patch of sunshine.”</p>

<p>The club was beginning to fill up now. In
the reading-room two or three members
turned over the out-of-date papers&mdash;but there
is really no date in Faloo. Little groups on
the lawn in front of the house sipped cocktails.
Lord Charles Baringstoke went from group to
group with his usual plaintive, “Anybody
goin’ to stand me anythin’?” Thomas was
fixing the <i>carte du jour</i> in the frame over the
dining-room mantelpiece; the fireplace was
filled with pot-roses in bloom, had never known
a fire, and did not possess a chimney. Two
other English waiters and many native
servants bustled to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John and Dr Pryce took their Manhattans
on the verandah. “Do you know,” said Sir
John, “I almost thought you were going to
elect King Smith this morning.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said the doctor. “Believe we
ought to have done it too. He’s better than
that worm Charley Baringstoke, or a boozer
like Cyril Mast, or a mean badger like Bassett.
Better than most of us, in fact. It was Bassett
put me off it.”</p>

<p>“So I noticed,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Interesting man too,” said Dr Pryce.
“Has he really got these ideas&mdash;the ambitious
poppycock that you talked about?”</p>

<p>“If he had, would you let him make a start
with them?” asked Sir John, enigmatically.</p>

<p>“I would not,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“I think you’re the man I want. We’ll
talk about it at luncheon. Our curry should
be ready by now.”</p>

<p>The meal was called luncheon, but for all
classes on the island luncheon was the
principal meal of the day; in fact, no regular
club-dinner was served in the evening. Most
of the members were gathered in the dining-room
now, but a small table had been reserved
for the President and Dr Soames Pryce. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the next table Mr Mandelbaum, a round-faced
German of great girth, was entertaining
Lord Charles Baringstoke, who under alcoholic
influence was being betrayed into confidences.
“You see,” he whined loudly, “it wasn’t
so much that I went a mucker, because of
course all my people went muckers; it was
the particular kind of mucker that I went.”
The German passed a fat hand over his salient
moustache and addressed him as “my poor
frent.”</p>

<p>Sir John and the doctor conducted their
conversation in more discreet tones.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” said Sir John, “that the
King really meant to be elected to-day? Did
he sound you?”</p>

<p>“He’s not on those terms,” said Pryce.</p>

<p>“He could have made a certainty of it if
he had not let Cyril Mast get drunk last night
and had sent him up to the scratch this
morning. He could have done that. It
would have been Mast and Bassett against
you, and my casting vote would not have
come in.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he took things too easily. But
why should he get himself put up?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you my views. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
move to blind you and others&mdash;to make you
think that he hankered for nothing but the
joys of European civilisation and the society
of white men. His genial manner and his
free hospitality are a blind of the same nature.
The man’s native through and through, soul
and body. He is playing the game for his
own natives, with himself at the head of them&mdash;as
he is indeed to-day&mdash;but in a position of
much greater power and dignity.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say it isn’t so,” said Pryce. “But
what do you build on?”</p>

<p>“Several things. I’ve known Smith a long
time, and I’ve only once known him miss a
trade opportunity. He won’t sell liquor to
his own natives. He won’t let them get it.
The stills and liquor-stores are taboo. He’s
after money, but he won’t do that. You’ve
noticed it yourself. About two months ago
I was going along by the beach one night, and
I turned into Smith’s place for a drink. He
was alone in his office, sitting at a table, with
his back to me, and working on some papers.
“Hullo, Cyril,” he said, without looking
round. Evidently he was expecting Mast.
There was a tin trunk open on the floor, and
it was packed with blue-books and pamphlets&mdash;things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of that kind. I went up to him and
touched him on the shoulder. I don’t think
he was so pleased to see me as he said he was.
King Smith was studying the native depopulation
statistics in the different groups, and
making notes on them. King Smith had
got old dailies and weekly reviews&mdash;radical
rags&mdash;with passages marked in blue chalk,
spread before him. I tried to see more, but
he was very quick&mdash;shovelled them all together,
threw them into the tin trunk, and kicked the
lid down. He said that he had been reading
some dull stuff, and then out came the whisky,
of course.”</p>

<p>“I wonder now if he’d have any chance.
I think he might.”</p>

<p>“Given that he had the money, and that
he could get into touch with English publicists&mdash;journalists
or politicians of a certain kind&mdash;I
think he’d have a very good chance at first.
Of course all traces of his liquor business would
be traded off or sunk in the Pacific by then.
The Little-Englanders and sentimental radicals
would back him to a man. It would be
shown that he had governed well, kept
the natives sober, and was fighting for
admitted independence to keep them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the dangerous influences of white civilisation.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pryce, “they are undoubtedly
dangerous&mdash;for natives.”</p>

<p>“There are depopulation statistics to prove
it. The fact that he handed us all over to
what they are pleased to call justice would
count in his favour. His patriotic attitude
would appeal. The fact that the island is
too small to matter, and that no expense was
involved, would help. If he caught the
country in the right temper, with nothing of
real importance to distract its attention, the
<cite>Chronicle</cite> and <cite>News</cite> would scream ‘Faloo for
its own people!’ for a while. In the end it
would be protection&mdash;French or British&mdash;but
that doesn’t matter a straw to us. We should
be done. Look here, doctor, I’ve made one
mistake in my life and I can’t afford to make
another. Whether Smith’s ideas are exactly
what I say or not, he is trying to do things
which will attract attention. We can’t let
him start.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Pryce. “And how do
we stop him? Money comes first, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I’ve already been into that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
point. Smith must never be much richer than
he is now; if he goes on with this money-lending,
he must be rather poorer. Of course,
Bassett can see nothing but twenty per cent.
instead of ten, and some of the other members
are like him, but I think we can do without a
dividend for a year or two if necessary.
There’s no need to show our hand. We can’t
adopt deliberately a thwarting policy. But
I have an idea that when Smith begins to be
too prosperous he will lose a schooner with a
valuable cargo. A store or two may be
burned down. Some new line of business,
which has been suggested by his English
friends, is likely to be a financial loss. The
second point is that he must not get into
touch with the people who can help him&mdash;publicists.
It would not be healthy for us to
have much written about Faloo in the London
papers. Well, he can’t get away himself&mdash;his
trade and the natives tie him by the leg.
There’s no telephone or telegraph here&mdash;thank
Heaven!&mdash;and our mail arrives and leaves
irregularly in one of his own schooners, which
has to go hundreds of miles with it. I fancy
that if you chose to go a cruise in that schooner
something might happen to any letters it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
carried which were not to the general interest.
You could manage that?”</p>

<p>“Pleasure&mdash;at any time.”</p>

<p>“I may ask you to do it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Sweetling, that’s all right, of
course. But I fancy you’re looking so far
ahead that you’re missing the next step. The
row with the natives about their women is the
next step. And although there’s no need to
get into blue funk about it, like Bassett, it
may very easily be the last step too.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Sir John. “I’m going to
speak to some of the men about it. I wish
you’d tackle Cyril Mast.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dr Pryce, “it’s rather difficult.
You see, I’m not exactly qualified for&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;stained-glass
treatment myself, and Mast
knows it. For that matter, I could tell you
a true story about the amiable Bassett. However,
I’ll advise discretion&mdash;if they’d only
remember that all the native women don’t
come into the same category it would be all
right. By the way, you were rather down on
Cyril Mast.”</p>

<p>“The man’s a human sink.”</p>

<p>“There are times when that describes him.
There are also times when he’d shock Naples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and make Port Said blush. There is no act of
madness which he might not possibly commit.
But he has his moments. I’ll try to find him
in a lucid interval. Good Lord! I wonder why
King Smith doesn’t give the natives their head
and wipe the island clean of the whole lot of
us.”</p>

<p>“Excellent prudential reasons. Smith
banks&mdash;has been compelled to bank by those
who financed him. His cheques require the
signatures of two Englishmen as well as his
own. It is awkward at times to have a bank
so far away, but I thought it advisable that
the money should not be kept here.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the doctor, rising
from the table. “I’ve got a native with
pneumonia down on the beach. I’ll go and
look at him.”</p>

<p>“Half a moment,” said Sir John. “Last
time a schooner came in, two piano-cases were
brought ashore. I’ve looked round, and the
only piano in the island is in Smith’s big concrete
house, where he never lives, and that
piano was there ages before. Pianos? Guns,
my boy. Smith’s keeping the natives in
check for all he’s worth. It’s his best policy.
But if it does come to an outbreak, you’ll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the natives armed and Smith leading them.
You can tell Mast that. If Smith gets into a
position where he finds his hand forced, and
it’s a question of the white man or the native,
he’ll throw over his trade and his ambitions,
wipe out the white men, and chance it. Now,
haven’t I seen the next step? Pryce, I watch
everything. I can’t afford to make another
mistake.”</p>

<p>“An almighty row&mdash;a big fight&mdash;and then
wiped out, as you say,” said Pryce, meditatively.
“One might do worse.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. All the same, I’m going to
spend this afternoon in frightening the life
out of Parker and Simmons and Mandelbaum
and Lord Charles Baringstoke. I
leave it to you to make Cyril Mast ashamed
of himself.”</p>

<p>“He’s always that,” said Pryce, as he turned
away.</p>

<p>Mr Bassett had said that he was going to
see Cyril Mast; therefore it was quite certain
that he was going elsewhere. He had taken
luncheon with King Smith, had eaten baked
fishes with the eternal cokernut cream sauce
and a conserve of guavas which was one of the
King’s trade-items. He had drunk with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
moderation of an excellent hock and iced
water.</p>

<p>Three sides of a square on the beach were
occupied by the King’s stores and office, with
some living-rooms attached. The styles of
building were various. There was concrete,
dazzlingly white in the sun. There was
timber. There was corrugated iron. There
were shanties built in the native fashion&mdash;poles
planted close together for the walls, and
a leaf thatch for the roof. The King had a
fine concrete house with an excellent garden
in the interior, but he rarely visited it.</p>

<p>Luncheon had been served by native boys
in one of the living-rooms. The King now
smoked a Havannah and sipped coffee which
he himself had grown. There was surprisingly
little that was native in his appearance. He
wore a white flannel shirt, white duck trousers,
and white canvas shoes, all of spotless cleanliness.
His tint was very light. He had none
of the native’s love for personal decoration with
flowers and necklaces. His eyes were not like
a native’s. They had not that sleeping gentleness,
and were the eyes of a master among men.
No native would have worn those shoes. The
natives went barefoot as a rule, torturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
themselves with squeaking boots on state
occasions or as a concession to the French
missionaries. But the King had all the
native’s inborn grace of movement, and he
wore his hair rather longer than a European’s.
He looked at Bassett with that slightly cynical
air of a man who has gauged another man completely,
will use him to the utmost, and will
not trust him quite as far as he could throw
him. Bassett had removed his big hat, and
his indecent baldness shone with perspiration;
it gave something of the appearance of the
vulture to a head which otherwise suggested
the ape.</p>

<p>“All I can say is that I did my best,” said
Bassett, plaintively. “It nearly came off.
Dr Soames Pryce had seemed all in your
favour, and then just when it came to the
voting, he went right round.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Smith. His voice was pleasing
and his pronunciation was perfect. “And
was that just after you had spoken?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Bassett, “and that’s what
makes it so surprising.” The King smiled.
“We ought to have had Mast there. I said
so.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, my friend,” said King Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“you did your best and who can do more?
Perhaps, when Sir John and the doctor have
got to trust me a little more, I may be elected.
If they do not think I am yet fit for the high
honour of membership, I must wait. It is
bad to force oneself. I can wait very well.
There was a time when every inch of this island
belonged to my forefathers; but I must remember
that I own comparatively little myself.
I am a king by direct descent; but I
must not forget that I am a poor trader far
more than I am a king. I owe much to the
white man. It is his money that has helped
me to develop the resources of my island.
It is to the white man that I owe my education.
Many are kind enough to come in sometimes
for a little chat with me. Further intimacy
is to be a matter of consideration&mdash;after all
it is not unnatural.”</p>

<p>“You seem to take it smiling,” said Bassett.</p>

<p>“My friend, you were, I think, what you
call a solicitor. That means a great education.
I often look at you with envy when I think of
the vast number of things that you must know
and I do not, and of the things that would be
easy for you to arrange and are so difficult for
me. But if I might venture to give one little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
piece of advice, it is this&mdash;always take a defeat
smiling and a triumph seriously. Ah, you
must take that as a joke. I cannot tell you
anything you do not know.”</p>

<p>“It’s true enough that to be a solicitor one
must pass very severe tests,” said Bassett.
“And every day of practice in a good firm
means a lesson in knowledge of the world.”
He was quite unused to flattery, and was ready
to take a good deal of it.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the King, “you do not
drink my cognac, and it is too good to miss.
Alone I would not have got it. It comes to
me by favour of the padre.”</p>

<p>Bassett, who knew his physiological limitations,
hesitated, filled his glass and sipped.
He expressed an opinion that the French
missionaries knew how to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bassett continued. “As a solicitor
I met with all kinds of men. I can generally
make an estimate. I have my doubts about
Dr Soames Pryce. I have raced lizards
against him; doctors know drugs and can use
them.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was too preposterous, and
the King’s laughter was both hearty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
natural. “But I think not. It is unlikely,”
he said. “The doctor is not in any want of
money, and he does not risk his position here
with all of you for a little piece of ten shillings. I
do not know much, and so I have to guess a good
deal. I should guess that it was no question of
money that sent Dr Soames Pryce to Faloo.”</p>

<p>King Smith watched his guest with a critical
eye. It was not generally advisable to speak
of the past in Faloo. Lord Charles Baringstoke
was quite shameless, and the Rev. Cyril
Mast was occasionally maudlin, and these two
had chattered about themselves, but members
of the Exiles’ Club were mostly discreet and
reserved as to their personal histories.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it money?” said Bassett, peevishly.
“No. Perhaps not. Perhaps it was something
worse&mdash;something which could not be
misunderstood.”</p>

<p>“Then these money troubles in your
country&mdash;the sort of troubles that have decided
some of you to leave it&mdash;may possibly
be only due to misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>“That and other things. You see, you
don’t know about these matters.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the King, regretfully, “I do not
know that great world in which you moved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, see here,” said Bassett a little
excitedly. “Suppose there is a sum of money&mdash;a
hundred pounds or a thousand, any sum
you like. You know as a business man that
if you were asked for that sum one day you
might be unable to find it&mdash;though you would
be able to get it if you were given time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see that.”</p>

<p>“I had money belonging to clients&mdash;ladies
of course. They were very impatient, and
consulted another solicitor, a jealous rival.
The money was being employed by me in a
way that would ultimately, if I had been left
alone, have benefited those clients. It was
not immediately available, and delicate
financial operations do not admit of clumsy
interference. The result was disastrous. I&mdash;I
gave up and came here.”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful that you knew of this little
island.”</p>

<p>“I had heard of it&mdash;two men that I knew
had already gone out.”</p>

<p>“Your clients&mdash;they were not all ladies?”
said the King, as he refilled Bassett’s glass
“I suppose traders like myself consulted you&mdash;clergymen
too, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“There are no traders like you in England,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
said Bassett. “But men of the highest
business standing consulted me. Lechworthy
now&mdash;I’ve lunched with him often. A Cabinet
Minister was one of my clients. I tell you, I’d
some of the very top. I daresay you never
heard of the great libel action against the <cite>Daily
Message</cite>&mdash;well, I acted for the <cite>Message</cite>.”</p>

<p>King Smith had listened very attentively.
“That must make a difference,” he said.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Men like that would be superior to a
vulgar misunderstanding. They would see,
as I do, that it was a mistake&mdash;that you had
acted for the best&mdash;that your probity was not
in question. It must be pleasant for you here
when the mail comes in&mdash;friendly letters from
Mr Lechworthy, who manufactures the leather
goods&mdash;letters still showing his gratitude from
the editor of the <cite>Daily Message</cite>, or p<span class="lock">erhaps&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“You don’t know anything, my boy,” said
Bassett. He was slightly flushed, his voice
was raised, and his manner was more familiar.
“The editor of the <cite>Daily Message</cite> indeed!
That case cost his proprietor close on fifty
thousand. You make me laugh. No, when
a man in England goes under, nobody goes
down to look for him. Lechworthy, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his piety, was as hot as anyone against me.
The only letters I get are from my old mother,
and they’re no use.”</p>

<p>It was not then through Mr Bassett’s personal
connections that King Smith would be
able to get into touch with the right people for
the scheme which he had in view. Cyril Mast
and Lord Charles had also boasted an influential
acquaintance, and in their case, too, the
thread had been snapped. The King was not
disappointed. He had found out what he
wished to know, and he had no further use
at the moment for Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>The King rose. “I must go back to my
work,” he said. “Stay here and drink if you
like.”</p>

<p>But Bassett also rose. “I have drunk
enough,” he said as he peered at his face in a
scrap of mirror on the wall. He wondered
vaguely if he had been talking too much. He
tried to think of something complimentary
to say. “I&mdash;I respect the way you work,”
was his effort; and then certain fears recurred
to his mind. “I say, is it all right about the
native women?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the King, “it is not all right.
But there will be no serious trouble yet, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
further cause is given. I have been busy
about it this morning.”</p>

<p>“Awfully good of you,” said Bassett.
“You’re a sort of protection to the white men
here. I say, you ought to have been elected,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Remember that there may come a time
when I cannot protect. The natives here
are not much spoiled. This is not Papeete.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m always saying to our
chaps.”</p>

<p>“Say it also to yourself, my friend. I had a
man here this morning who wished to kill you.
No, he will not do it. Now I must go.”</p>

<p>It was a very sobered Bassett that skulked
back along the beach to the club-house. He
jumped perceptibly when a land-crab rattled
an old meat-tin on the stones. At the club
it seemed to him that most of the men were
sulky and bad-tempered. Some slept on the
verandah. The German and Lord Charles
Baringstoke bent over an interminable game
of chess. Lord Charles looked up as Bassett
passed.</p>

<p>“I say, Mr damned Bassett,” said Lord
Charles, “why didn’t you elect Smith?”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the devil!” said Bassett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
irritably, and went on to his own room. He
was angry with himself, and a man in that case
is always angry with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>King Smith went on with his work, assiduously
as a London clerk under the eye of the
senior partner. It was near sunset when he
came out on to the beach.</p>

<p>Down by the water’s edge stood the Rev.
Cyril Mast. He was quite a young man, and
his face was that of a dissipated boy. At
present he was looking out through glasses
that he could not hold quite steady.</p>

<p>“You look at nothing,” laughed Smith.</p>

<p>“See for yourself,” said Mast, in a musical,
resonant voice. “Your schooner will be in
before you expected her.”</p>

<p>King Smith took the glasses and levelled
them at the little speck on the horizon.</p>

<p>“It is a schooner, but not mine,” he said.
“A chance trader perhaps. Mine can’t be
here for three days. That one can’t get here
to-night. To-morrow morning we shall see.
And how do you feel to-night, Cyril?”</p>

<p>“As I deserve to feel, I suppose. I am bad
company to-night. You are the first person
to whom I have spoken to-day, and I have
neither eaten nor drunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor devil, come up and have a drink
now.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’m going for a swim.”</p>

<p>“Don’t recommend it,” said the King.</p>

<p>“The sharks are welcome,” said Mast.</p>

<p>The sun set. Light streamed out from
native-built houses. In all directions one
heard the sound of singing. It mingled with
the lap and fret of wavelets on the shore.
Mast swam out and back again in safety. As
he walked along the beach a native girl called
to him. She stood in the light of one of the
houses, a flower of scarlet hibiscus behind her
ear; her white teeth shone as she smiled.</p>

<p>One by one the lights of the houses went out.
The sky became gemmed with many stars.
Faloo was asleep. The King had put aside
for a while his problem&mdash;how to get in touch
with an Englishman who could help him.</p>

<p>In the schooner that he had sighted there
was such a man, though the King did not know
it&mdash;a man of great wealth, a newspaper proprietor,
a keen politician&mdash;Mr Lechworthy,
who manufactured the leather goods.
The circumstances that brought Mr Lechworthy
to Faloo must now be recorded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The factories of Lechworthy &amp; Co.
covered many acres at Setton Park,
and the large village adjoining was inhabited
almost solely by those employed in the
factories.</p>

<p>In the factories as in the offices of Lechworthy
&amp; Co. one found the last word of
effectiveness and enterprise. Time after time
good machinery had been scrapped to make
way for better and to meet American competition,
and the enormous outlay involved
had subsequently justified itself. Everything
connected with their business was manufactured
at Setton Park. Boxes and crates were
made there. They made every metal article
required&mdash;from the eyelets of a pair of cheap
boots to the gold fittings of the most
expensive dressing-case. They made their
own glue. They even made their own
thread.</p>

<p>Lechworthy &amp; Co. were good employers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
They paid fair wages, and in the treatment
of their workwomen went far beyond what
the Factory Acts required of them. Allotments,
cricket fields, libraries, recreation halls
abounded. Lechworthy &amp; Co. had themselves
seen to it that the least paid woman in the packing
or lining departments could obtain an abundant
supply of pure milk for her babies at a price
she could easily afford. The sanitation was
excellent, and the delightful air of the country&mdash;for
the tannery was at a judicious distance&mdash;made
town-workers envy their more fortunate
comrades at Lechworthy’s. Thrift was compulsory
and automatic. The man who grew
old and past work, or who broke down from
illness in the company’s service, found ample
provision made for him from funds to which
his own savings had contributed, augmented
by the company’s generosity. Such a man
need not leave Setton Park; there was a
cottage for him, and it was not called an
alms-house; medical attendance was provided
free for him. The conditions still prevailed
which were established when Lechworthy
turned his business into a Limited Company.
The ordinary investor had never been given
a chance to put a penny into the concern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Lechworthy had by far the largest holding,
and the other shareholders were men of a
like mind, personal and political friends;
men of substance, and, it was averred, of
nice conscience. The company earned an
excellent dividend, in spite of its philanthropical
ideas.</p>

<p>It was not of course to be expected that
Lechworthy &amp; Co. would entirely escape
criticism. The man who has political friends
has also political enemies, and the political
enemy is not always too scrupulous in the way
in which he inquires into his opponents’
private business. A part at least of the raw
material which the company purchased had
been subjected to comment. Their attitude
towards any smaller manufacturer was characterised
as merciless&mdash;he was absorbed into
Lechworthy’s, or he was frozen off the face
of the earth. The scheme of compulsory
thrift was commented upon even by those who
did not deny a value to compulsory virtues.
It was said quite truly that any man who
voluntarily left the company’s service, or who
was dismissed for misconduct, thereby sacrificed
all that he had been compelled to put by.
It was answered as truly that every man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
entered the service knew upon what conditions
he entered it, and that the company had a
right to guard itself against disloyalty, defection
and disorder, by all the means in its
power. In view of the fact that Lechworthy
had always proclaimed freedom of religious
and political opinions, it was held to be remarkable
that ninety per cent. of his work-people
shared his political views, and that while
every shade of dissent was represented among
them, it was hard to find a member of the
Church of England and impossible to find
either a Catholic or an Agnostic. If this
were mentioned to Lechworthy he said merely
that he had been fortunate, or that he supposed
that like attracted like. He was sincere, and
had strong convictions; he was also shrewd
and knew that strong convictions depend
amazingly little upon argument. Many a
workman of Lechworthy’s had professed for
mercenary and time-serving reasons a religion
which had afterwards become real to him&mdash;not
as the result of a cool reasoning analysis,
but by sheer force of habit and by the unconscious
effect of example. Now and again
a discharged servant of the company asserted
bitterly that he had been discharged for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
political or religious views, but the head of his
department always had another story to tell,
and the evidence of discharged servants is
always&mdash;and quite properly&mdash;discounted.
A more serious charge was that he had kept
on servants whom he should have discharged.
Mr Bruce Chalmers, the Conservative candidate,
had attempted to address a meeting of
the men in their dinner-hour. Lechworthy’s
young men had smashed up the motor-car, and
hurled stones and mud at himself, his wife,
and his supporters. Mrs Bruce Chalmers had
been seriously injured, the police had come
to the rescue, and several of these fervent
young men had been imprisoned without the
option of a fine. But their situations were
still waiting for them when they came out,
and in some of the worst cases promotion
rapidly followed. Lechworthy maintained that
he had told Chalmers that if he addressed
the men he would do so at his own risk, and
that those who provoked a breach of the peace
should not complain if the peace were broken.
If, as he supposed, the law had punished his
men sufficiently, it would have been unnecessary
and unjust for him to punish them further.
Those who knew that two words from Lech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>worthy
would have prevented the outbreak,
or knew what Lechworthy’s attitude would
have been to a workman who had been fined
for drunkenness, did not think the defence
satisfactory. For the rest, the selection of
books in the free library at Setton Park
provoked a sneer, the blacking out of all
the racing news in the reading-room papers
seemed a little childish, and the absence
of a rifle-range, when gymnasia, swimming-baths,
and cricket fields were liberally provided,
was taken as an instance of the
short-sighted methods of professed lovers of
peace.</p>

<p>At the age of sixty Lechworthy determined
to retire from the board of his company. He
had relinquished the position of managing
director some years before. He was not so
young as he had been&mdash;it was his favourite
observation&mdash;and other men could be found
to take his place on the board. He was an
active Member of Parliament and he was the
proprietor of the <cite>Morning Guide</cite>. The paper
did not pay, and Lechworthy did not run it to
pay; he said more than once in public that he
ran it in the service of Christ. Incidentally,
it was of some use as an organ of his political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
party, and a most enthralling hobby for himself.
While in England he was quite incapable
of leaving the editor alone for two days together.
The same doctor who had recommended
him to retire from the board of Lechworthy
&amp; Co. had suggested a prolonged
holiday in some place where it would be
impossible for him to see a copy of the <cite>Morning
Guide</cite>.</p>

<p>The occasion of his retirement had of course
to be marked. Sounded upon the subject,
Lechworthy had objected to the service of
gold plate or to his full-length portrait by the
most fashionable and most expensive artist.
He did not want for money, or for the things
that money can buy, and he said that he
thought the talented artist might find some
more pleasing subject. He knew too, that
subscriptions would come from many who
could ill afford to give them, and that idea
was repellent to him. But he consented to
receive an illuminated address, to which his
employees might affix their signatures. The
address swelled itself to a book, every leaf of
the finest vellum, magnificently bound,
majestically expressed. The title-page declared
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="center smcap">
<i>To</i> WILBERFORCE LECHWORTHY, Esquire,<br />
Justice of the Peace and Member of Parliament<br />
          for South Loamshire,<br />
    on the Occasion of his Retirement from<br />
              that Business<br />
    which his Genius and his Untiring Industry<br />
  have with the Blessing of the Almighty<br />
              Created.
</div>

<p>The presentation of this rather portentous
volume was to take place on a Saturday
evening. On the afternoon of that day every
employee of the company was invited to tea by
Lechworthy. A number of vast marquees
were erected for the purpose on the cricket-field;
and the return match between Setton
Park and the Hanley Wanderers was in consequence
postponed. The <cite>Evening News</cite>
headed its paragraph on the subject: “<span class="smcap">Lechworthy
packing&mdash;who made the portmanteau?</span>”
But the paragraph itself dealt
seriously with statistics supplied by the firm
of caterers, informing the curious how many
hams or how many pats of butter had been
thought sufficient. The Setton Park Band
performed on the occasion. The antique
show of Punch and Judy was to be seen freely,
and swings were prevalent. Wilberforce Lech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>worthy
went from one marquee to another,
joined in the audience that witnessed the
flagrant immoralities of Mr Punch, and chatted
with the crowds that waited for their turn at
the swings. He displayed a king-like memory
for faces and the geniality of a headmaster
on Speech-day. The presentation of the address
took place some hours later in a hall
which, though it was the largest at the company’s
disposal, could not provide seating
accommodation for one third of its workers.
Heads of departments had tickets, and
seniority of service counted. For those who
were of necessity omitted, Mr Lechworthy had
provided a fine display of fireworks. Inside
the hall the Bishop of Merspool was in the
chair, Mr Albert Grice, M.P., was ready to
speak, and the address was to be presented by
Mr Hutchinson, supported by speeches from
Mr Wallis, Mr Salter and Mr Bailey. In spite
of this, either from altruism or from want of
thought, several of the privileged workmen
offered their tickets freely to comrades who
had otherwise to be content with the display
of fireworks; nor were these offers invariably
accepted. Some observations by the Bishop
on the influences of religion in our commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
life occupied five lines in the papers next
morning, concluding, “The presentation then
took place.” The <cite>Morning Guide</cite> was more
explicit and gave nearly a column. It reported
the Bishop, Mr Grice, and Mr Hutchinson;
it summarised Mr Wallis and Mr Salter,
and asserted that Mr Bailey (who had spoken
for twenty-five minutes) “added a few words
of graceful eulogy.” All it said of Mr Lechworthy
was the bald statement that he returned
thanks. Thus, indeed, had Mr Lechworthy
directed.</p>

<p>None of the papers noted the presence on
the platform of Miss Hilda Auriol, the niece of
Mr Lechworthy, nor can it be pretended that
she constituted an item of public interest.
But, for the idle purposes of this story, something
must be said of her, even if, in consequence,
it become necessary to suppress any
detailed account of Mr Bailey’s words of
graceful eulogy, or of the Bishop’s rediscovery
that it is better to be good.</p>

<p>Wilberforce Lechworthy, childless and a
widower, had been glad to adopt Hilda Auriol,
one of his married sister’s very numerous
family. At the age of six he professed to
have detected in her a decided character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
She was now twenty-three, and her uncle
was very fond of her, but she was perhaps the
only person of whom he was much afraid.
Let it not be supposed that her temper was
either sour or dictatorial. She was sunniness
itself, and her criticism of life&mdash;including her
uncle&mdash;was fresh and breezy. Her perspicacity
detected and her soul abhorred anything
that was specious and plausible; in practical
politics and in the conduct of a great modern
business the specious and the plausible have
unfortunately their place, and Wilberforce did
occasionally say things after which he experienced
a momentary reluctance to meet his
niece’s eye. She had a sense of humour and
she was by nature a fighter. Her uncle himself
was not a keener politician, and it was
perhaps fortunate that in most respects their
politics were identical. If she had asserted her
independence she had not lost her femininity;
she did take much thought as to the wherewithal
she should be clothed, and she liked
admiration. And she got it. If she had not
already refused six offers of marriage, it was
merely because she had not allowed six men
to go quite as far as they had intended.
Heart-whole, she had not yet met a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
much interested her, nor was she trying to
arrange the meeting. She paid no great
attention to athletics, but she could swim a
mile, could sit a horse, and was a really good
shot with a revolver. Of the last item her
uncle had not entirely approved. “Why
not?” said Hilda. “It’s a question of instinct.
Instinct wouldn’t let me play football
or smack a policeman’s face, but it does
let me learn to shoot and want to vote.” She
explained that she was only ready to use
violence if it were not her own violence but
the violence of the other sex. “For instance,
when young Bruce Chalmers had the
cheek to try to address your men, I would not
have thrown stones myself, but&mdash;if I had been
there&mdash;I would have encouraged the men
who did throw them.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake don’t say that,” said
her uncle. “It was a lamentable occurrence,
and it was most unfortunate that it was a
woman who was hurt. It has done us more
harm than good.”</p>

<p>Hilda laughed. She had a rather disconcerting
laugh.</p>

<p>At the presentation she had looked charming.
In the afternoon she had made friends with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dozen babies and played games with them, and
she still wore her afternoon dress. But she
looked fresh, cool, unruffled, delicately tended.
Her mutinous little mouth remained firm and
quiet, but a wicked brightness came into her
eyes whenever a speaker achieved unconscious
humour&mdash;and this was a calamity which
occurred to most of the speakers. On the
other hand, when Mr Grice recalled “an
intensely amusing anecdote related to me by
an old Scottish lady,” Hilda sighed gently
and seemed to be thinking of far-off sad things.
To such an extent may feminine perversity
be carried.</p>

<p>Mr Grice, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Wallis
were all directors of the company, and returned
to London in Mr Lechworthy’s special saloon
carriage. The express stopped at Setton
Park by arrangement to pick it up. The
Bishop had already spread his ecclesiastical
wings in another direction. Supper was
served at a little flower-decked table in the
carriage for the party of eight. The three
who have not already been mentioned were
Lechworthy’s elderly unmarried sister, who
was nervous and good-natured; Burton, his
secretary, who had obligingly taken a short-hand note;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and Mr Harmer, quite recently of
Corpus, Oxford, and at present a leader-writer
on the <cite>Morning Guide</cite>. Mr Harmer wore at
first the air of a man who had got the little
party together and meant to be kind to them,
even if they did not quite reach his level. Later
he had a brief conversation with Hilda Auriol,
to whom he wished to say complimentary
things; Hilda, metaphorically speaking, smote
him between the eyes, and thereafter he wore
the air of a dead rabbit. Yet she addressed
her uncle’s secretary as Tommy, and went
into fits of laughter over his excellent but
irreverent imitation of the Bishop of Merspool,
done for her private delectation. She was
polite and charming to Mr Hutchinson and
Mr Wallis, who admired her intensely; and
to Mr Grice, who admired her quite as much
as a married and middle-aged Member of
Parliament had any business to do. Altogether,
it was a cheerful little party. Mr
Lechworthy, his sister and his niece did not
touch the dry champagne to which the others
did justice; but Mr Lechworthy’s ginger-ale,
taken in a champagne-glass, presented a
colourable imitation of festivity. At the
moment of the cigarette, Miss Lechworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and her niece retired to rest with instructions
that they were not to be called before London.</p>

<p>In the little saloon, when the supper-table
had been cleared, the men sat round and
chatted, Mr Harmer alone being taciturn&mdash;which
was unusual with him. If the conversation
was now more serious it was quite optimistic.
Mr Grice removed a faded malmaison
from his button-hole, jerked it into the outer
darkness, and remarked that it must be
difficult for a man of Mr Lechworthy’s splendid
energy to get himself to take a holiday at all.</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy was smoking the briar pipe
which he permitted himself after dark. His
figure was lean, and at this late hour of night
did not show any sign of fatigue. He sat upright.
His hair was grey, but he had no
tendency to baldness. He did not wear
spectacles or false teeth. He certainly seemed
for a man of his age unusually strong and
healthy. But he made his customary observation
that he was not as young as he had been.
He spoke of his holiday plans.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Mr Wallis. “I suppose
you go to Sydney first?”</p>

<p>“Sydney and then Auckland. Might go
on by one of the Union boats from there. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
I want to get a little off the usual lines, and I
think that I should do better to buy or hire
a schooner there. I know very little about
such things, but I have friends at Auckland
who would help me. I’m fond of sailing.”</p>

<p>“You’re to be envied,” said Grice. “No
business, no House of Commons. Nothing to
do but enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy fixed his rather fanatical eyes
on him. “Nothing to do but enjoy myself?
That would be a poor kind of life, Grice. No,
no. Let me use my holiday as I have tried
to use politics, journalism, and even the
business with which I have just disconnected
myself&mdash;to the highest service of all.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Hutchinson. “The rest&mdash;the
gain in health and strength&mdash;will be valuable
to you, because they will enable you to
resume that service.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. True enough. But I had
thought of something beyond that. A voyage
without an end in view would not greatly
interest me, and even if one does not work one
must at least have some sort of occupation.
Our friend, Mr Harmer, will laugh at me, but
I am proposing to write a pamphlet&mdash;it may
even be a little book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>It should surely be abhorrent to a leader-writer
to laugh at his proprietor’s ambitions.
Mr Harmer did not laugh. He left his
taciturnity and his brandy-and-soda to observe
that he was convinced that Mr Lechworthy
already possessed materials for a dozen books&mdash;interesting
books too. If there was any difficulty
about getting the thing into literary shape
Mr Harmer would only be too happy, etc., etc.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. If I don’t ask
you, it won’t be because I don’t know your
capabilities in that way. But, you see, Mr
Harmer, I’m not going to try to do anything
literary. I couldn’t. And if you did it for
me under my name, I should be wearing
borrowed plumes. Tell you what I’m going to
do&mdash;I’m going to make notes of the different
missions in the islands I visit. I can only
touch the fringe of the subject, of course.
Goodness knows how many inhabited islands
there are where I’m going&mdash;Eastern and
Southern Pacific&mdash;and I shall only have six
or eight months there. Still I want to wake
up our people about South Sea Missions.
The ordinary man knows nothing about the
islands. What could you, Tommy, for instance,
tell us about them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dunno,” said Tommy, reflectively. “I
read some yarns about them when I was a kid.
All coral and cokernuts, ain’t they?”</p>

<p>“Ah! There are human souls there too.
Yes, and I’m told that in one group at any
rate Roman Catholicism is rampant. There’s
work to be done.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Grice, “if we hadn’t been
fools enough to let the French slip in and grab
what they <span class="lock">wanted&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Grice, my friend, let us be proud that in
one instance, at any rate, this country has not
done all the grabbing. I’m not going to
suggest that we should add one square foot
to our possessions. We have too much&mdash;territorially,
we’re gorged. No, let us see
rather what we can do to spread the true
religion in place of the false. That’s what I
feel. If I can do one little thing for the cause
of true religion, then my holiday won’t be
entirely wasted.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Mr Wallis, who suddenly
felt that his cigar and the glass in front of him
had been inappropriate.</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy’s fist descended solemnly
on the table before him. “True religion&mdash;that’s
the only thing. I’ve kept it before me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in my business. I’ve tried to show that it is
possible to treat the workman as a brother,
to consider his soul’s eternal salvation, and yet
to make a fair profit. I’ve dared to bring
practical religion into journalism. <cite>The Morning
Guide</cite> loses me so much every day, so much
every year. The money’s set aside for it&mdash;to
produce a paper which will never print a
divorce case or an item of racing news&mdash;a paper
in which every <i>feuilleton</i> clearly and
distinctly enforces a good moral&mdash;a paper
which will be the sworn foe of this blatant
self-styled imperialism. In the House I
venture to say that I belong to the religious
party. You’ll find little religion among the
Conservatives&mdash;and what there is, is largely
tainted with ritualism. Unprofitable servant
that I am, little though I have done, I have at
least kept my faith and carried it into my
life.”</p>

<p>There were a few seconds of silence. Then
somewhere at the back of the saloon a fool of
a servant opened a bottle of soda-water. It
went off with a loud and ironical pop. The
gurgle of the fluid seemed to utter a repeated
tut-tut. But Mr Lechworthy was unperturbed.
Gliding easily into another subject, he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to talk about cameras. His book or pamphlet,
whichever it might be, was to be profusely
illustrated. Mr Wallis, an amateur photographer
of some experience, was lavish with
his advice. Later, a possible title for the book
was discovered. Mr Grice, who had been a
little sleepy, grew suddenly alert again and
almost disproportionately enthusiastic. “A
magnificent and noble enterprise that could
only have occurred to yourself, Lechworthy,”
was a phrase that possibly overstated the
facts. Tommy Burton slept peacefully&mdash;poor
Tommy Burton&mdash;much in love with Hilda
Auriol and condemned to perpetual cheerfulness
and brotherhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus it happened that the schooner which
Cyril Mast had sighted bore with it to the
island of Faloo Mr Lechworthy and his niece.
He had never intended to take Hilda with him
at all, but then Hilda had always intended to
go. Faloo had never been part of his programme,
and all that the skipper could tell
him about it was that it was wrongly charted;
but Hilda had caught a glimpse of it in the
evening light and decided that she must spend
an hour or two there. It was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
discovered that the ship needed oranges and
taro, and that Faloo might as well provide
them. Lechworthy still had a will of his own,
but then the captain knew so much more and
Hilda cared so much more, and the sweet content
of the South Seas had settled down upon
him. He had eaten peach-flavoured bananas
and he was learning the mango. The expressed
juice of the fresh lime, mingled with ice and
soda-water, seemed to him the best drink that
had ever been found. As to the missions&mdash;well,
he was getting a general impression (which
bothered him a little, because it was not quite
the impression that he had meant to get), and
he would fill in the bare facts later. He had
taken many photographs and would develop
the rolls of film as soon as he could find the
time&mdash;unless he came upon somebody who
would do them for him.</p>

<p>At dawn the <i>Snowflake</i> lay in a dead calm
just outside the reef. Cyril Mast took a good
look at her. The snowy decks, the brilliant
white paint and the polished metal showing
a hundred bright points of light in the sunshine,
told that this was no ordinary trader. Had
the retreat of the exiles been discovered at
last? No, for the ship to come in that case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
would be something sterner than this pretty
toy. In a few minutes he had changed his
clothes; and now his collar, his necktie and
his waistcoat proclaimed his calling. He
could manage a canoe excellently himself&mdash;it
was his favourite pastime when sober&mdash;but
now his dignity demanded that a couple of
natives should propel him out through the
opening in the reef to the schooner’s side.
The natives&mdash;as curious as Mast&mdash;were eager
for the work. At the moment the mad idea
which Mast subsequently carried out had not
yet entered his head. All that he wanted was
to find out what the schooner was, and if
possible to get some break in the accursed
monotony of his island life. He wanted,
pathetically, to exchange a few civilities with
some white man who did not know too much
about him&mdash;to catch a glimpse of the outside
world that had been closed to him. That was
why he wore the starched dog-collar that was
so uncomfortable, and the frayed black alpaca
jacket, and the waistcoat of clerical cut. He
had not worn them for ages; but he meant
now, for an hour perhaps, to get back to the
old time, before certain events had made
Faloo the only place in the world for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Already there were many natives on the
beach, adorned with wreaths and necklaces
of flowers, wearing holiday clothes. It might
be of course that the schooner was merely
waiting for a wind, but perhaps a boat would
come ashore and there would be much festivity.
Possibly some order had come to them from
King Smith, for a few of the natives who would
have launched their canoes were restrained by
the others; and the two men who had taken
Cyril Mast out did not attempt to go on board.
Of King Smith himself nothing was to be seen.
The white men still slept peacefully in their
bedrooms at the club, or in their own houses.
The schooner was Cyril Mast’s own discovery;
none of the others knew of its arrival.</p>

<p>On the deck of the <i>Snowflake</i> Mr Lechworthy
came forward with hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“I don’t know your name, sir,” he said,
“but I am glad and proud to meet you.
Missionary enterprise is a subject in which
I take the deepest interest. My name’s
Lechworthy&mdash;you may have come across it
in connection with my business.”</p>

<p>Cyril Mast stammered his own name. He
was astounded. He, the pariah, the outcast,
had been mistaken for a missionary. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
man of wealth and position was admiring his
heroic self-sacrifice. And that beautiful girl
with the laughing <span class="lock">eyes&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Permit me, sir, to present you to my
niece, Miss Auriol.”</p>

<p>Miss Auriol took one glance at his pimply,
blotchy complexion, and in great charity
remembered that there was a complaint called
prickly heat and that a prolonged sojourn in
the tropics must be unhealthy for a European.
She chatted freely. They expected to sail
again later in the morning, but were sending a
boat ashore to see if they could get some fresh
fruit. Her uncle and she had thought of
going in the boat and getting an hour, perhaps,
in Faloo.</p>

<p>As she spoke, Cyril Mast made up his mind.
He would act the part that had been given
him. The deception could not be kept up for
any length of time, but it might be managed
for one hour. It was simple enough to call the
club the mission-house. Few if any of the
members would be about at this hour, and he
could manage to get breakfast served at a
table on the lawn outside the house. An hour
in which to see this beautiful English <span class="lock">girl&mdash;</span></p>

<p>He found himself speaking rapidly. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
must certainly come ashore and have breakfast
at the mission-house. His canoe would pilot
their boat. It would be the greatest pleasure
for him to show them something of the island.
See, that was the mission-house there among
the orange trees.</p>

<p>Hilda Auriol and her uncle agreed that it
looked charming; the invitation was at once
accepted. Preparations for their departure
and the arrangements for their return were
made at once. Cyril Mast’s canoe flew over
the water, the schooner’s boat following.
Speaking partly in the native tongue and
partly in English he explained to the crowd
on the beach that the ship was “Mikonaree.”
He would take the “Mikonaree” and his
daughter up to the club, where they wished
to go. The others&mdash;they must entertain them
as best they could&mdash;would be going up to the
stores to buy things and the King would direct
what was to be done.</p>

<p>On their way up from the beach to the club-house
Mr Lechworthy asked if Mr Mast had
been long on the island.</p>

<p>“Four years.”</p>

<p>“And never a holiday?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mast, who every moment felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
more like a real missionary, “no, I have
needed no holiday.”</p>

<p>“Rather lonely, I should think,” said Hilda.</p>

<p>“Well, one has one’s work. There are
other white men on the island too&mdash;traders
and planters. You may possibly see some of
them up at the mission-house.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy began on the subject of his book&mdash;his
projected work on the missions of the
South Seas. A native girl ran up with a necklace
of flowers for Hilda. Mast began to talk
more easily and fluently, falling into the part
that had been assigned to him. He described
King Smith, that prodigy among natives, with
accuracy and with some humour. He was
sketching the French Mission for his guests as
they entered, with exclamations of delight,
the beautiful garden of the Exiles’ Club.
Somewhere at the back of his head Mast was
wondering why King Smith had not appeared.
The arrival of a schooner constituted a great
event. What could he be doing?</p>

<p>Just at present the King sat in his office,
deep in thought. Another event had happened
which made the schooner’s arrival of comparatively
little importance in his eyes. It
was the first sign that his power might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hold back the native outbreak, and it had
come before he expected it. In the early
morning, while it was still dark, the King as
he lay awake had heard a scream&mdash;brief,
agonised. It seemed to be fairly near&mdash;a
hundred yards or so away. He had lighted a
lantern and searched the scrub at the back of
the stores. There he had found the dead body
of a white man with a native knife sticking
in his throat. The white man was Duncombe,
and no complaint against him had ever
reached the King’s ears. It was a private
revenge, and might not end there.</p>

<p>The King decided and acted quickly.
Already the body was buried out of sight,
covered with quicklime in a shallow grave.
Hundreds of the natives were in a state of
angry ferment, held back by the King with
difficulty; if they saw that the first step had
already been taken, it would be impossible
to hold them back at all. The King himself
had been the grave-digger and had kept his
own counsel. Duncombe would be missed at
the Exiles’ Club that day. On the morrow his
friends would be anxiously searching for him.
Meanwhile, the King would have found out the
assassin and would have used the strange gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with which the natives credited him. He
would talk to the man seriously in the melodious
native tongue, and say that he wished for his
death. No other step would be necessary.
The man would go back to his hut, refuse food,
remain obstinately silent, and presently draw
a cloth over his face and die. In what way
the death was caused the King could not have
told you, though once before he had used this
gift. Modern science may choose between an
explanation by hypnotic suggestion, or a blunt
denial of a fact which has been credibly
witnessed and reported.</p>

<p>In a few days the strange disappearance of
Duncombe would be forgotten. The King felt
sure that for a while at any rate no further
provocation would come from the white men.
The natives would quiet down again, and their
King would be free to follow the line of his own
ambitions.</p>

<p>For the moment nothing else could be done.
The King roused himself and went out to look
at the schooner. Word had already been
brought to him that this was not a trader.
His interest was no more than idle curiosity.
He did not know that already there reclined
in a lounge-chair on the lawn of the Exiles’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Club the man for whom he had been seeking.
Lechworthy proposed to enjoy his hour or two
in Faloo; he also did not know. He did not
know that he was destined to remain in Faloo
for days, and to meet with incidents that were
but little enjoyable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>The Rev. Cyril Mast left his guests for a
few minutes on the lawn, while he went
into the club to order breakfast. The hour
was early, but not unusually early, and the
Exiles’ Club never closed. For a few hours
after midnight the staff was much diminished,
and only one of the white servants was on duty,
but even then a member could always get
anything he wanted. At least two-thirds of
the members had bedrooms at the club.</p>

<p>But to-day the club did not wear its air of
morning freshness. The soiled glasses and
laden ash-trays of the night before were left
still on the little tables on the verandah and in
the hall. Not enough windows had been
opened, and the sour smell of stale cigar-smoke
poisoned the place. Even the Rev. Cyril
Mast, who was by no means particular,
noticed it. A reluctant native servant was
sent to find Thomas, and failed; a minute
later Thomas arrived of his own volition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the bedrooms, looking hurried and worried.
His quick eye noticed Mast’s clerical clothes.</p>

<p>“I say, Thomas,” said Mast, “this place is
in a hell of a mess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Thomas, and gave a rapid
order to two native servants. “Very sorry,
sir, but it’s all the schooner.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s made so many of the gentlemen unusually
early. Quite a little excitement, when
we first heard about it, sir. Seems it’s just a
chance visit from some missionary, but it’s
meant more for us to do here&mdash;gentlemen
requiring baths and breakfasts. Three orders
to give at this moment.”</p>

<p>“Do that first, and then I can talk.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Thomas, and called
down the speaking-tube. “Drinking cokernut,
large gin, ice and dry biscuit to Lord
Charles. Got that? Right. Tea and boiled
eggs, Mr Bassett. Got that? Right. Those
two lots in the bedrooms at once. Coffee, two
pork chops and stewed pineapple to Mr
Mandelbaum downstairs in twenty minutes.
Yes, that’s all. Now, sir, I’m ready.”</p>

<p>“I have two guests from the schooner&mdash;one
of them is a lady&mdash;and I want breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
for them in the garden. And, look here,
Thomas, they’re here for only an hour or so,
and we’ve got business, and if possible I don’t
want to be interrupted by any of the gentlemen.
Put the table in some secluded corner. See?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. Sir John and Dr Soames
Pryce are out already, sir, but they will probably
have gone to the beach, and I think
there’s no other gentleman down yet.”</p>

<p>As they settled the details of the breakfast
more windows were opened and a strong,
fresh breeze blew in from the sea. Under
the eye of Thomas the native servants moved
more quickly and order began to be restored.</p>

<p>“You manage those beggars pretty well,”
said Mast.</p>

<p>But Thomas was pessimistic. Four gallons
of methylated spirits had been stolen from the
club stores, and for the life of him he couldn’t
find out which of his boys had got it. It was
his belief that the only man who could really
manage them was King Smith.</p>

<p>The Rev. Cyril Mast had been careful to
place chairs for his guests where the orange-trees
screened them from any view of the house.
Mr Lechworthy was perfectly contented to stay
where he had been put. He was quite happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and he promised himself that presently he
would acquire valuable material for a sketch
of a Protestant mission on one of the smallest,
the loneliest, and the most beautiful of the
South Sea islands. Meanwhile he had risen
very early, and he had some ability for the five-minute
snooze. His head went back and the
brim of his black felt hat shaded his eyes.
But Hilda Auriol had sighted a big parrot,
swaying on its perch in a patch of sunshine,
and it was her wont to make friends with all
tame birds and beasts.</p>

<p>She went up and spoke to the parrot. The
bird gave a husky cough, imitated the act of
expectoration, and began to say the three
worst things it knew. Then it sat blinking
and thinking in silence. As Hilda passed the
verandah, the French windows of the card-room
were flung wide open, and she caught
one glimpse of it&mdash;precisely as it had been
left the night before. She returned and
roused Mr Lechworthy.</p>

<p>“There are at least sixteen missionaries
here, uncle, which seems a good many for such
a small island. The sixteen play cards, drink,
and teach a parrot bad language. I don’t
think I like them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy was much startled. “What
do you mean, my dear?”</p>

<p>Hilda told him precisely what she had seen&mdash;the
card-room with the four tables, at all of
which play had taken place, and the other
tables piled with glasses, gazogenes, and tiny
decanters. She pointed out the parrot, and
once more the bird became clearly articulate
and quite reprehensible.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it,” said Mr Lechworthy.
“The thing’s incomprehensible. I
must see into this&mdash;there may be something
which I shall have to put a stop to. I ought
not to have brought you here, Hilda. You
must leave me and get back to the boat at
once.”</p>

<p>Hilda laughed. “Oh, no. We’ll see it
through together. Here comes our host.”</p>

<p>“Well, he shall have his chance to explain.
He spoke of other white men&mdash;traders and
planters. They may be responsible. It is
impossible to believe that a minister of the
true religion would&mdash;No, he will explain.”</p>

<p>Hilda and her uncle went forward to meet
Mast. They stood now in full view of the
house and close to the entrance to the garden.
Mast was voluble in his apologies. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sorry to have kept them so long, but he was
afraid his native servants were not very intelligent.
He feared that breakfast would be
rather primitive when it did arrive. But they
would have it in a spot from which one of the
loveliest views in the island could be obtained.</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy smiled pleasantly. He and
his niece preferred to live quite simply, and
it was most kind of Mr Mast to entertain them
in any case. “While we are waiting for breakfast,
perhaps you will show us the mission-house.
We should particularly like to see
that&mdash;the church, too, that you built for the
natives.”</p>

<p>Cyril Mast made three different excuses
in three different sentences. Lechworthy
watched him narrowly, and drew one or two
correct conclusions. His pleasant smile
vanished, and beneath their heavy brows his
eyes looked serious.</p>

<p>And then Bassett’s curious little figure
appeared on the verandah. He had hurried
through his breakfast and was hastening down
to the beach to find out what he could of the
schooner. But he was scarcely outside the
doors before the wind, blowing now with increasing
force, caught up his big felt hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
whirled it into the bushes. Bassett chased his
hat, and for the moment did not notice the
little group by the orange-trees. But Lechworthy’s
quick eye had already recognised
him.</p>

<p>“That man over there&mdash;is he also engaged
in missionary work?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In a sense, yes,” stammered Mast.
“<span class="lock">He&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“It will be interesting to talk to him about
it. I happen to know him, and I will call him.
Bassett!”</p>

<p>Bassett was startled and turned sharply.
He came very slowly across the lawn, much
as a dog comes to his master for punishment.
What on earth was Lechworthy doing in
Faloo? Was he, too, flying from justice?
That would explain the arrival of the schooner
and the fact that he was evidently on friendly
terms with Cyril Mast. But Bassett had to put
that notion aside. Knowing Lechworthy, he
knew that it was not possible. And Bassett
was very much afraid. What did Lechworthy
mean to do? Well, he must put the
best face on it he could. A defence that
would be torn to rags in court might seem
plausible enough in Faloo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr Lechworthy,” said
Bassett. “This is a great surprise. Morning,
Mast.”</p>

<p>“Bassett,” said Lechworthy, “Mr Mast,
whom I had not met before, brought us here
from my schooner. He has told me that you
are associated with him in his missionary work
here. Now you, Bassett, I have met many
times before, and I know your history.”</p>

<p>But it was not Bassett who answered; it was
Cyril Mast, whose face was white and twitched
curiously.</p>

<p>“This is my fault, Mr Lechworthy,” said
Mast. “I had not meant to represent myself
to you as a missionary. But you made the
mistake, and I was tempted to go on with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lechworthy, quietly. “I
don’t think I see why. You hardly seem to be
enjoying a practical joke.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? For four years I have not
spoken with a decent white man or woman.
We are all the same here&mdash;and we’re here because
there’s no other place left. If you had
known about me&mdash;the truth about me&mdash;you
would not have spoken to me at all. That’s
all. Don’t ask me any questions, please. I’m
going to leave you now. Get back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
schooner at once; any of the natives on the
beach will find a canoe for you.”</p>

<p>Without a word to Bassett Mast raised
his hat and turned away. He went up the
steps of the verandah and into the club-house.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Hilda, “that his advice is
good. It’s blowing hard now, and the <i>Snowflake</i>
can’t lie where she is&mdash;with the reef on
her lee.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, we will go. But I must
have a few words with Mr Bassett in private.
Go on ahead of us a little.”</p>

<p>And now Bassett found his tongue. “You
must not pay any attention to what Mast said,
Mr Lechworthy. Mast is a good fellow, but
he suffers from fits of morbid depression in
which he believes himself to have done horrible
things&mdash;the life here is very lonely, you know&mdash;no
amusements of any kind&mdash;nobody to
speak to.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy thought of the card-tables.
“Bassett,” he said, “it’s not about Mast but
about yourself that I wish to speak. Many
have looked for you and have not found you.
I have found you unwittingly&mdash;I think because
I was sent to find you. You are a thief,
Bassett. You are a murderer, for one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
poor women whose property you stole took her
own life.”</p>

<p>“I am absolutely innocent, Mr Lechworthy.
I have a complete explanation. You&mdash;should
be careful, sir. I have seen men shot dead on
this island for saying less than you have said
to me.”</p>

<p>“Do not try to frighten me, Bassett. I am
ready for death when God wills, and death will
come no sooner than that. You are coming
back home with me, Bassett. You’ve fled
to the far corner of the earth, and it’s no use;
your sin has found you out. You are coming
back to take your trial, and, if need be, your
punishment. Do that, and I will help you by
all the means in my power. I will help you
to make your peace with man and to something
better&mdash;your peace with God. It’s the one
way to happiness. You’ll find no way here.
Turn back for nothing. Come now, this
moment.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke Bassett had made his plan.
Hilda, a few yards in front of them, turned
round. “Which way?” she called.</p>

<p>“The little track to the right, if you please,”
called Bassett, “it’s the shortest.” Then
he turned to Lechworthy. “I will come,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
said. “I put myself in your hands unreservedly.”</p>

<p>The little track to the right was very narrow
and led through thick scrub, damp and
odorous with the scent of the frangipani
bushes. Hilda, well on ahead, fought her
way through a tangle of lianas. Behind her
came Lechworthy, crouching and going
gingerly, serenely happy. Behind him at a
little distance came Bassett, his hat under his
arm, sweating profusely, the revolver which
he had taken out from his pocket held clumsily
in his shaking right hand.</p>

<p>And some way behind Bassett, going far
faster than any of them, and unseen by
any of them, came the lithe figure of King
Smith.</p>

<p>Just as Bassett fired the King’s club came
down heavily on his head. Hilda turned with
a cry, as she heard the report, and struggled
back again to her uncle. Mr Lechworthy
had at last found a place where he could stand
upright and ease his aching back. He held
his black felt hat in his hand, and examined
the bullet-hole in the rim with a mild, inquiring
benevolent eye.</p>

<p>“You are not hurt, uncle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not in the least, my dear, thanks to this
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Get up,” said King Smith to Bassett.</p>

<p>Dazed, rubbing his sore head with one hand,
Bassett staggered to his feet. He looked from
one to the other bewildered. In this wind,
that gave a voice to every bush, he had not
heard the approach of King Smith. And now
his revolver lay on the ground, and the King’s
foot was on it, and it was the King who spoke
in a way that Bassett had not heard before.</p>

<p>“I have finished with you. Go where you
like and do what you like. And a little before
midnight you will die.”</p>

<p>It was the definite sentence of death, and
Bassett knew it. Half-stunned as he was,
he could still lie and make a defence.</p>

<p>He began an explanation. He had taken
out the revolver to draw the cartridges and
stumbled. The thing was a pure accident.
But of course King Smith was not in earnest.
He could not sentence a white man to death
like that. He would be elected to the white
men’s club in a few days. The white men were
his partners in business, <span class="lock">and&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The King cut him short. “It is to the
King and not to the trader that you speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
now,” he said, as he picked up Bassett’s revolver.
“Do not compel me to shoot you
where you stand. It is better that you should
have a few hours to arrange your affairs.
Shortly before midnight, remember.”</p>

<p>Bassett turned away in silence. Certainly
the white men would act together and stop
an outrage of this kind. He must see Sir John
and Dr Pryce at once.</p>

<p>The King was transformed immediately
from a stern judge into a courteous man. He
made many apologies to Lechworthy. He
brought news from the <i>Snowflake</i>, from which
he had just returned. The wind had got up
so suddenly that there had been no time to
send for Lechworthy; the schooner had run
for the lee of the island.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr Lechworthy, that the English
have a proverb that it is an ill wind which blows
nobody any good. I confess that I am very
glad to get this opportunity of speaking with
you. You can help us very much in this
island if you will. Of course my palace in
the interior will be entirely at the disposal
of yourself and your niece. A guard will be
placed there, and I can guarantee your personal
safety. I will do my best for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
comfort. And in a day or two, when the
hurricane has blown itself out, you shall go on
your way again if you will.”</p>

<p>“We owe you our lives, sir,” said Mr Lechworthy
with some dignity. “And now we
must thank you for your hospitality as well.
It is as though God had sent you to save us.
We shall come to you willingly and with the
utmost gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Hilda.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the King, “you will do
me a greater service than anything I am able
to do for you. Now, if you will follow me
back to the next clearing, some of my people
will be waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing,” said Hilda,
hesitatingly. She had never spoken to a King
before, and she was rather shy about it.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said the King, smiling. “The
schooner? It will be quite safe.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Hilda, “that I meant&mdash;er&mdash;clothes.”</p>

<p>“I foresaw that,” said the King. “Everything
in that way that could be got together
in the few minutes that we had to spare has
already been brought ashore in my canoes. If
there is anything further that you would like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
another canoe will go out to the schooner as
soon as it is practicable.”</p>

<p>“Thanks so much,” said Hilda, fervently.</p>

<p>They retraced their steps to the clearing,
for the path by which Bassett had taken them
led only into the scrub. Many natives were
in waiting, full of smiles and excitement. To
one group after another the King gave rapid
yet careful directions. Some sped inland and
others down to the beach. Presently some
twenty of the native boys were racing on
bicycles up the road to the King’s house.
Soon only two of the natives remained, two girls
of surpassing beauty, chosen by the king from
many aspirants. The King turned to Hilda.</p>

<p>“Miss Auriol, these two girls wish to be your
friends, and to do everything that you want
while you are on the island. They will be in
attendance upon you while you are at my house,
if you will let them come. They are of my
kin, and they speak a little English. If you
will have them, you will make them very
happy.”</p>

<p>Hilda had already been watching the girls
with frank admiration. “Oh, yes, please,”
she said eagerly. “There is nothing I should
have liked better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Tiva and Ioia flew to her side at once.
Hilda made in them pleasant discoveries of
shyness, <i>naïveté</i>, curiosity, the utmost friendliness,
and a delicious sense of humour. Their
questions were many and amazing, their
broken English made her laugh, and their
laughter echoed her own. Even in the short
descent to the beach, these fascinating people
made her forget how near she had been to
tragedy. The beautiful island of Faloo that
had begun to be dark and hateful to her took
up its charm again.</p>

<p>Behind the group of girls walked Mr Lechworthy
in placid converse with the King.</p>

<p>“Events happen quickly here,” said Lechworthy.
“A bogus missionary&mdash;a meeting
with an absconding solicitor, whom I knew
in his better days&mdash;an attempt to murder me&mdash;my
escape, for which I thank you, sir, and,
unhappily, the sentence of death.” He hesitated,
and then ventured to point out that in
England an attempt to murder was punished
less severely.</p>

<p>To the ignorant native the English practice
seemed to be illogical and to put a premium
on bad shooting. But he did not raise
this point. He said that he had never pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>nounced
sentence on a white man before,
though the white men in his island had done
much wrong. This was not the only offence
that Bassett had committed, and it was
necessary that he should die. “Here, you
see, I am the King and the law&mdash;and my island
is not England. It is all different. You will
see later.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then the King said,
“I already know something of you, Mr Lechworthy.
I read your speeches at the time of
the South African war, and an article about
you which appeared a year or more ago in
a paper called the <cite>Spectator</cite>. I have your
pamphlet about Setton Park, and I have many
copies of the <cite>Morning Guide</cite> containing articles
signed by you. I cannot tell you with what
joy I found it was you that the <i>Snowflake</i> had
brought. You, perhaps more than any other
Englishman, can help us here.”</p>

<p>“Every minute, sir, I become more surprised.
Here, many hundreds of miles from
civilisation, I find a native king who speaks
English like an Englishman, procures and
reads the English papers, even knows something
of such a seventh-rate politician and
busy-body as myself. But, sir, with the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
will in the world to help you in any way that
my conscience permits, I don’t see what I am
to do.”</p>

<p>“If you are kind enough to permit me to
dine with you to-night, I will explain everything.”</p>

<p>They had reached the beach, and once more
the King changed the subject.</p>

<p>“You breakfasted at the Exiles’ Club?
No? I thought perhaps that might be so.
Well, it is all ready here.” The King led the
way to a broad balcony of his unofficial
residence, well sheltered from the wind.
“You will be more comfortable at my house
inland&mdash;here there is not much.”</p>

<p>Certainly, the plates and cups were of various
patterns and had seen service; the forks and
spoons were not coated with a precious metal,
and the use of the Union Jack as a cloth to the
low breakfast-table could only be excused by
those who saw that a compliment was intended.
But Mr Lechworthy drank the best coffee he
had met in the islands, and devoured in blind
faith delicious fruits of which he did not even
know the names. “Also very good,” he
murmured at every fresh experiment. King
Smith had business needing his attention else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>where,
and it was Tiva and Ioia who waited
upon his guests. Nominally these two girls
did not breakfast, but Tiva ate sugar when
she happened to come across it, and Ioia drank
coffee out of Hilda’s cup when Hilda had
finished with it. In the intervals they learned
the word “Hilda,” and exchanged the story of
the robber-crab for hints on hair-dressing. Of
their own toilette they spoke with an innocent
freedom, utterly open-air and natural, which
to some European girls might have been disconcerting.
But Hilda had picked up the
right point of view, an invaluable possession
to the traveller anywhere. She had talked
and played with native girls in Tahiti and other
islands, but she had found nothing so charming
as Tiva and Ioia.</p>

<p>“When shall we go on to the palace?”
Hilda asked.</p>

<p>“Sometime&mdash;plenty quick,” said Tiva.
The answer was not precise; but then to Tiva
the question was idle, for what on earth does
time matter?</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Mr Lechworthy, “if you
could tell us anything about this palace? It
must be an interesting place.”</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy inspired the girls with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
awe. It was quite clear to them that he was
a very great chief indeed, and possibly King
Edward VII. Never before had King Smith
received any white man in this way. Wherefore
Tiva hid her face in Hilda’s shoulder.
Ioia said thoughtfully that the palace was a
“plenty-plenty big house.” She had thoughts
of adding a few picturesque inventions&mdash;it was
so hard for her not to give everybody everything
they wanted&mdash;but she refrained. It
subsequently transpired, in talk with Hilda,
that neither Tiva nor Ioia had ever seen the
King’s official residence. It stood in a big
garden, hidden by trees, and the whole place
had been taboo to all native women. A few
of the native men had charge of it, and no one
else had been allowed to enter. This would
be changed now. Tiva and Ioia were to
reside there as long as Hilda remained, and it
was clear that they looked forward with delight
to this privilege and, possibly, to the satisfaction
of their curiosity.</p>

<p>King Smith himself announced that all was
now ready for the drive to his house in the
interior. There were two light, well-built
buggies, with island ponies harnessed to them.
Hilda and her two attendants went in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
vehicle, followed by the King and Mr Lechworthy.
The luggage had already gone on,
borne on the heads of natives. The drive was
along a wide, white-powdered road, bordered
on either side by groves of palms. Glorious
bougainvilleas made streams and splashes of
colour. The tall utu scattered its graceful
plumes of rose and white. Sheltered though
the road was, the travellers could hear the
roar of the wind, and now and then a soft thud,
as a nut heavily-husked thumped to the ground.</p>

<p>As they went, the King told Lechworthy
all that he wished to know about the Exiles’
Club.</p>

<p>“But how can you permit it, sir&mdash;this lazar-house,
this refuge for the worst scum of Europe
polluting your beautiful kingdom?”</p>

<p>“I have not only permitted it, I have even&mdash;in
vain&mdash;tried to become a member of the
club. I have done even worse. My friend,
if a man wishes to escape from a prison, he will
use good tools, if he has them, to break through
the walls. And if he has not good tools, he
will use anything that comes to his hand&mdash;rusty
iron, old nails, anything. And he will
use them even if they hurt his hand and put a
festering wound in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I see what you mean. I will
not judge hastily. To-night, I think you
<span class="lock">said&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“To-night I tell you everything. You will
find much to condemn, much that is hateful to
you. But you love liberty and you will help
my people in spite of all. Then I shall no
longer need the bad tools, and I shall put them
down. And as for the festering wound in my
hand, I shall burn it with a little gunpowder
and in time it will be made whole again.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy, watching him as he spoke, was
conscious that he had found here a master
among men, clear in purpose, indomitable in
pursuit of it. But where was the man’s
Christianity? What were his political purposes?
Was there no danger in being drawn
into them? Well, that night he would see.
He had already found that the King could be
inexorable, and that it seemed impossible to
procure postponement of the execution of
Bassett even by one single hour.</p>

<p>Bassett himself was horribly frightened, but
he did not believe that the sentence of death
would be carried out. For the moment King
Smith was angry; later in the day Bassett
would see him again, or would get Sir John to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
do it for him. He would persist, of course, that
the shot was accidental. Besides, King Smith
might be pleased to say that he did not speak
as a trader, but he still was a trader, and on the
trader the members of the Exiles’ Club could
bring very stringent and serious pressure to
bear. If the King still persisted&mdash;well, it was
easy enough for him to pronounce sentence,
but he would find it impossible to carry it
out.</p>

<p>In the hall of the club Mr Bassett found the
Rev. Cyril Mast and Lord Charles Baringstoke.
The latter was shivering in pale blue pyjamas
and an ulster; he had not yet bathed, neither
had he brushed his yellow hair. The two men
were getting on well with a bottle of doubtful
champagne.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mr damned Bassett,” said his
lordship. “You’ve got a lot of blood on your
collar. Somebody been crackin’ your egg for
you?”</p>

<p>Bassett took no notice of him. He turned
upon Mast and swore hard at him. So
choked was he with rage that he could hardly
articulate. He repeated himself over and
over again. Had Mast gone clean out of his
mind? What had he done it for? What had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he brought Lechworthy there for? Lechworthy
of all people! He stormed and
spluttered his abuse.</p>

<p>“Lechworthy was my guest and you can
mind your own business,” said Mast, sullenly,
and refilled his glass. “If you swear at me
again, I’ll hit you.”</p>

<p>“My business?” screamed Bassett&mdash;but he
did not swear this time. “Why, wait till
you’ve heard. We’re done&mdash;every man of us&mdash;and
all the result of your folly. You haven’t
seen King Smith, but I have&mdash;and he means to
take my life to-night. Oh, what’s the good of
talking to you boozers? Where’s Pryce?
Where’s Sir John?”</p>

<p>“Ask the waiter,” said Mast.</p>

<p>“Look here, old friend, I’ll tell you. Pryce
and Sir John went out to find Duncombe,”
said Lord Charles. “Duncombe’s been stopping
out all night. Naughty, naughty! And
won’t he catch it from Sir Jonathan Gasbags?
Jaw, jaw, jaw! Lordy, I had some of it
yesterday! I say, Bassett, has anything really
been happening? Because, if so, I should like
to be in it. Why, there they are!”</p>

<p>Sir John and Dr Soames Pryce entered from
the verandah. Mast and Bassett both began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to speak at once, angrily and in a high voice.
Lord Charles Baringstoke gave a quite good
imitation of a north-country pitman encouraging
a dog-fight. The noise was terrific.
Members came out from the reading-room to
see what was happening. Servants paused on
the stairs to watch.</p>

<p>Sir John’s walking-cane came down with a
crack on the table before him. “Silence!”
he roared. And he got it.</p>

<p>“Now then,” he said severely, “is this a
club or a bear-garden? You&mdash;members of
the committee&mdash;behaving like this? Now,
Mr Bassett. Now, sir, I’ll hear you first.
And don’t shout, please.”</p>

<p>“A most serious thing has happened, Sir
John. I fear that we’re done for. I must see
you and Dr Pryce in private about it. And
the whole thing’s due to the damned folly of
this man Mast.”</p>

<p>The champagne bottle whizzed past his
head, missing him by a hair’s-breadth and
smashing on the opposite wall. Mast would
have followed up the attack, but he met a
quick fist with the weight of Dr Pryce behind
it; the lounge-chair on which he fell collapsed
under him, and he lay sprawling on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“You all seem very excited,” said Dr Pryce,
cheerfully. “I would suggest, Sweetling, that
you and Mr Bassett go off to his room, and I’ll
join you there in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Sir John. “Come on,
Mr Bassett. This must be discussed quietly.”</p>

<p>“Get up, old cockie,” said Dr Pryce, extending
a hand to Mast. “Made up your
mind to bring disgrace on the cloth this
morning, haven’t you? You’ve been drinking
too much. Go and lie down for a bit&mdash;you
can’t stand it, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good chap, Pryce,” said Mast.
“Perhaps I can stand it and perhaps I can’t.
But I’m going on with it for this day anyhow.
Thomas, I say, where’s Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Go to the devil your own way then,” said
Pryce, and followed Sir John and Mr Bassett.</p>

<p>Lord Charles Baringstoke turned to the on-lookers.
“Seem very cross, don’t they?”
he said. “Now is anybody going to stand
me one little brandy before I go up to bathe
my sinful body?”</p>

<p>In the secretary’s room Bassett’s story was
told at length. Sir John listened to it with
gravity and Dr Soames Pryce with a sardonic
smile. In the main Bassett stuck to the facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but he lied when he said that Mast was drunk
when he brought Lechworthy to the club.
“I left Lechworthy with King Smith, and he
can’t have got back to the <i>Snowflake</i>. So I
suppose that he’s with the King now.”</p>

<p>“Most likely,” said Sir John, drumming
on the table with his nails. “See, Pryce?
Remember what I said? Well, the King’s
got into touch at last. Lord knows what
Lechworthy was doing here, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pryce. “That is so. The
illustrious visitor will stop at His Majesty’s
official residence. That is why we met that
gang of boys cycling up there.”</p>

<p>“It was the worst of luck,” whined Bassett.
“If King Smith hadn’t come up just at that
moment I should have saved the situation.
You see that, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“Bassett, my poor friend,” said Dr Pryce,
“you’ve made every possible blunder. I
can’t think of one that you’ve left out. I’m
not going to argue about it, but it is so. So
don’t brag about saving situations.”</p>

<p>“You express my own opinion,” said Sir
John. “And the consequences of your
blunders, Bassett, are likely to be serious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anyhow, the consequences are serious.
The most serious of all is that my life is
threatened.”</p>

<p>Dr Pryce laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll pardon us if we don’t think so,”
said Sir John. “But you can cheer up,
Bassett. Threatened men sometimes live
long. Remain in the club. It will be well
guarded to-night. Every precaution will be
taken. Smith simply can’t get at you&mdash;short
of a general attack on the white men by the
natives, and he won’t risk that. It wouldn’t
suit his book at all just now. Meanwhile,
you appeal to Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“Surely he’s the last man in the world
<span class="lock">to&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“He’s the only man who’s likely to have
much influence with King Smith just now,
and he won’t approve of irregular executions.
If he asks to be allowed to take you back to
England, he’ll probably get you. And it’s
better to go than to die&mdash;also, you can probably
give him the slip somewhere or other on
the way.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bassett, rubbing his chin.
“There’s that. There’s always that.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Bassett,” said Dr Pryce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
suddenly, “we shall want four or five good
men to patrol outside from sunset to midnight&mdash;sober
men who can shoot and know when to
shoot&mdash;Hanson and Burbage are the right
type. Go now and find them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it at once. Shall I bring them
here?”</p>

<p>“No. Just get their names. I’ll talk to
them later.”</p>

<p>“And, I say, wouldn’t it be a good thing
if we elected King Smith a member now?”</p>

<p>“Might as well offer a mad buck-elephant
a lump of sugar. You go and find those
men.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Dr Pryce, as soon as Bassett
had gone.</p>

<p>“Smith will tell Lechworthy everything.
Lechworthy goes home with our names in
his pocket. Therefore he must not go
home.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Nor must other people go
home with similar information.”</p>

<p>“They must not,” said Sir John. “Therefore
we must get a man on board the <i>Snowflake</i>.
That ship must be lost with crew and
passengers. Our man may be able to save
himself or he may not. It’s a devilish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
risky business. Still, money will tempt
people.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t trust a paid man on that job,”
said Pryce. He reflected a minute. “My
lot’s thrown in with the sinners. Tell you
what, Sweetling&mdash;I’ll do it myself.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>The societies that are to be permanent
grow without plan, much as a coral
island grows. The schemed Utopia never
lives; it leaves no room for compromise and
becomes pot-bound; it guards with wise foresight
against numberless events which never
happen, and the unforeseen event blows in
upon it and kills it.</p>

<p>The Exiles’ Club had never been planned at
all. The first of its members to arrive at
Faloo&mdash;Sir John Sweetling&mdash;had not the
slightest intention of starting such a club. He
was a man of considerable ability and he had
been clever enough to see that the smash of
his tangled operations was inevitable, and that
any defence would be wasted speciousness.
Recalling to himself a voyage which he had once
made as a young man, he left before the smash
came and while he still had considerable means
at his disposal, even if he had no legal claim
upon them. A chance of that early voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had shown him Faloo, and it was his intention
to lie concealed in Faloo for two or three years
and then under a different name to resume
his business career in San Francisco.</p>

<p>He found himself hospitably received by
the priests of a small French mission and by
the King of the island. With the former he
never became on intimate terms, and he took
occasions to tell them more than once that he
was by education and conviction a member of
the Church of England. But he found the
King interesting&mdash;in his ambitions and energetic
character, as well as in his education and
appearance, totally unlike any island native
of whom Sir John had ever heard.</p>

<p>Sir John noted, too, that the island had
considerable natural resources, and that these
were capable of development; labour was in
any case cheap and plentiful, and, if he worked
in with the King, forced labour would also be
available. The King was a poor man, owning
nothing but the land which he had inherited,
within sight of wealth but unable to reach it
for want of the knowledge and capital without
which it was impossible to trade. Sir John
had always assimilated quickly and eagerly
any kind of business knowledge, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
picked up a good deal of useful information
about the island trade; his capital was safe
and at his command. Before long he had
entered into a partnership with the King, and
had purchased from him land and plantations
in one of the most delightful spots in the
island.</p>

<p>Of natural and inherent vice Sir John had
very little. Crimes of violence and passion
were distasteful to him. A love of money and
position had drawn him gradually into a
career of gross and abominable fraud, but it is
doubtful if he ever saw it as fraud himself&mdash;technical
error, committed with the best
intentions, is how he would have characterised
it. In the days of his prosperity at home he
had been rather a generous man. A church in
a London suburb boasted a pulpit of coloured
marble, which had been the gift of Sir John
Sweetling, and the munificence of the donor
had been the subject of a complimentary
reference in a sermon; nor would it be safe to
say that at the time he made this presentation,
though it was practically paid for with stolen
money, he was altogether a hypocrite. He
loved decency and order. He was always
anxious that the proper form should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
observed. He loathed that slackness of fibre
which leads men to unshaven chins or made-up
neckties. His orderly characteristics remained
fairly constant, even in a soft and enervating
climate, although in other respects, as we have
already seen, circumstances and the Exiles’
Club considerably modified him. At the time
of his arrival at Faloo he did not realise that he
was cornered. He prepared a return to the
outside world.</p>

<p>He was soon convinced that not in two or in
twenty years would it be safe for him to show
himself. He had trusted friends in England
who knew at least where letters could be
addressed to him, and they kept him informed.
At his own request he was sent copies of what
the Press had to say about his disappearance.
He read it all with amazement and with
extreme but temporary depression. These
writers, it seemed to him, were actuated by
spite and expressed themselves with virulence.
They ignored facts which should have told,
more or less, in his favour. They credited
him with no honest desire to restore money,
had his speculations been more successful.
They put the worst constructions on these
“technical” lapses. In the case of a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>spectus
they seemed to be unable to distinguish
between deliberate lies and an overstatement
incidental to a sanguine temperament. He
had never said to himself, “Let us steal this
money”; he had merely said, “Let us make
this investment look as attractive as we can.”
And does not every tradesman try to make his
goods look attractive? Is there any close and
ungarnished accuracy about the ordinary
advertisement? Sir John felt angry and sore
at the view which had been taken; but he
put his San Francisco scheme aside.</p>

<p>And then gradually were interwoven the
cords which bound him to Faloo for ever.
Two men, who had been personal friends of
Sir John’s and associated with him in business,
skipped their bail and joined him at Faloo.
It was natural and convenient that the three
men should live together, and their house was
the nucleus of the building which afterwards
became the Exiles’ Club. Through them
came a further widening of the circle. The
secret was kept for the discreet, and among
them was a city solicitor. He knew when to
talk about it. He had among his clients
families of the highest respectability, and all
such families have their black sheep. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Colonies might prove inhospitable and America
too inquisitive, but there was always Faloo&mdash;for
people who could afford to get there and to
live there. To Sir John belonged the prestige
of the explorer and pioneer; it was to him
that the new-comer came for advice, and
occasionally for investment. Sir John sold
part of his interest in the island trade to a
syndicate, and part of his land to the white
community, taking in each case such profit
as his conscience allowed. His abilities, too,
were admitted. He was a born organiser.
It pleased and amused him to undertake the
work of providing European luxuries in an
almost unknown island hundreds of miles
from anywhere. His judgment was unerring
in welcoming any desirable addition to the
fraternity and in arranging for the speedy
deportation of the undesirable. Men with
no money or education were as a rule excluded.
“We want gentlemen here,” said
Sir John, and struck the right note at once.
But he saw the usefulness of that ex-waiter
from the Cabinet Club, and Thomas had no
trouble in making good his position on the
island.</p>

<p>The position of director and adviser rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pleased Sir John; the position of President of
the Exiles’ Club pleased him far more and
sealed him to Faloo. It was a chance suggestion
which led to the formation of the club.
Six men sat over their Sauterne and oysters one
evening and listened to the music of the surf.
Presently one of them (nobody afterwards
remembered which one) said, “Sort of little
club of exiles, ain’t we?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then Sir
John, already with a foretaste of the presidential
manner, said, “Well, gentlemen, it
rests with you. I’m ready to put my money
down if you others are. The thing can be
done, and done well. Club-house and grounds,
decent service, everything comfortable and in
order. Why not?”</p>

<p>They discussed it during the greater part
of that night, and they all worked very hard
at it during the month that followed, planning
and superintending the construction of the
only two-storied building on the island. Sir
John had always been a great gardener, and
Blake, one of the earliest arrivals, had made
a hobby of his workshop. The special knowledge
proved very useful. Sir John was told
that English turf was impossible. “We shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
have our lawn just the same,” said Sir John.
And ultimately, at great trouble and expense,
they did have it.</p>

<p>The club never had any other President
than Sir John. If Smith, as the white men
called him, was the hereditary king of the
natives, Sir John was by common consent the
symbol of authority for the white men. Lord
Charles Baringstoke had not a respectful
manner, and frequently alluded to Sir John
Sweetling as Jonathan Gasbags, but he would
never have dreamed of opposing his annual
re-election to the presidency.</p>

<p>Customs grew as convenience demanded,
and rules were made as they were wanted.
The rules were kept almost invariably by
every member of the club; a reprimand from
Sir John was sufficient to prevent the repetition
of any lapse, and the feeling of the
majority of members was always against the
transgressor. At first sight this may seem
extraordinary. There was but one man in the
club who was not wanted by the police. It
included men like Lord Charles Baringstoke,
who did not possess, and never had possessed,
any moral sense. There were others, like
Cyril Mast, who had killed what was good in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
them and become slaves to the most ignoble
indulgences. There were members who
seemed for ever on the verge of an outbreak
of maniacal violence, and there were some who
were at times sunk in a suicidal melancholy.
It might have been foretold that such a club
would be doomed to destruction by the riot
and rebellion of its own members. But that
forecast would have proved incorrect.</p>

<p>It is, after all, a commonplace that when
anarchy has removed all existing laws and
government, the construction of a fresh
government and new laws will next have to
occupy its attention. Those who had rebelled
against an elaborate legal system, bore with
patience the easier yoke which was devised
for their own special needs, and often at their
own suggestion and instigation, in the island
of Faloo. Too high an ideal was not set for
them. Every form of gambling was permitted,
except gambling on credit. Among
the exiles there was neither bet nor business
unless the money was in sight. Intoxication
was frequent with some of the members, and
was not condemned, but it was recognised that
its propriety was a matter of time and place.
As ritual survives religion, etiquette survives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
morality, and no member of the Exiles’ Club
would have committed the offence of tipping
a club servant; nor would he have stormed at
a waiter however bad the service might have
been, but would simply have backed his bill.
There was no definite rule against profanity,
and its use was common enough, but there
were two or three men in the club&mdash;one of them
murdered his own mother&mdash;in whose presence
the rest kept a certain check on their tongues.
The principle was generally accepted that the
life of a member, so far as it concerned other
members, began with his arrival at Faloo.
Confidences were not sought; if, as rarely
happened, they were volunteered they were
not welcomed, lest they should demand confidences
in return. Briefly, the men, troubled
no longer with a complex civilisation, had made
for themselves their simple conditions of life,
and such law as was involved by those conditions
they respected.</p>

<p>Two other considerations made for the permanence
and well-being of the club. Few
of its members were habitual criminals; they
were mostly men who had ruined their lives
with one thing, and in other matters had been
normally respectable, and even over the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
men in the club the climate seemed to exercise
a curiously quieting and mollifying influence.
Secondly, it was very generally realised that
Faloo was the last station, the jumping-off
place. There was nothing beyond it, and there
was no other chance.</p>

<p>Sir John had already stated at the election
meeting some of the reasons which bound him
to Faloo. It may be added that he thoroughly
enjoyed his position. The society in which
he lived was small, but it held itself to be the
superior society of the island, and it bestowed
on him the first place. He had been the great
man of his suburb, and he found it to be almost
equally satisfactory to be the great man of
Faloo. The exploitation of a native king was
work which was quite to his taste, and at the
same time it was easy work. Shrewd and educated
though the King was, he showed himself
quite native, and pathetically ignorant at
first in matters of business. Sir John had but
to say that this or that was common form, or
the usual European practice, and the King
accepted it at once. But the King learned
quickly, and at a later period he had about
taken Sir John’s measure, as Sir John himself
was aware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor had Sir John any delusions about his
fellow-members. His manner was genial; he
would gamble and drink (in moderation) with
the sinners. But in his heart he despised
most of them. They had never had the great
idea and the Napoleonic collapse. Their
weakness and not their strength had been their
ruin. It was not their mind but their body
that had run away with them. Sir John had
not lived the life of an ascetic, far from it,
but his tastes were in favour of a decent reserve
and a sufficient moderation. From no man
will the slave of the flesh receive more hearty
contempt than from the man of the world;
and in the difficult task of his reclamation it
may be that the sneer of the worldling has
sometimes effected more than the tears of the
spiritual.</p>

<p>Yet even in his contempt for many of his
fellow-members he found some source of
gratification. He liked to wonder where on
earth they would have been without him, and
to feel his sense of responsibility increased.
From their depth he could contemplate with
the more satisfaction his own eminence.</p>

<p>But there were a few members whom Sir
John could regard with more respect. Bassett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
for instance, had worked admirably for the
club, and had shown something of Sir John’s
own talent for organisation. He had now
lost his head in a crisis and acted, Sir John
considered, like a fool. However, he would
get a good scare&mdash;Sir John doubted if the King
had really intended more than that&mdash;and
would not be likely to act on impulse again.
Then there was Hanson, a quiet man and an
ardent chess-player. He had character and
ability, and Sir John hoped that he would
one day replace the Rev. Cyril Mast on the
committee. Mast had a gift for public speaking,
and owed his election to it, but Sir John
found him quite useless. Probably the man
whom Sir John liked most, respected most,
trusted most and understood least was Dr
Pryce.</p>

<p>The men were as different as possible. Dr
Pryce had never shown the slightest interest
in the working of the syndicate which financed
Smith, although he was a member of it. He
had been approached by Sir John on the subject,
had put down his money without inquiry,
and apparently had never thought about the
subject again. In an ordinary way Sir John
would have taken this as evidence that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
man was a fool, but Pryce’s rather various
abilities could not be doubted. The doctor’s
contempt for vain assumption sometimes
wounded Sir John, who habitually called his
own vain assumptions by prettier names.
Pryce never pretended to be any better than
his fellow-members, nor had he that not uncommon
form of perverted vanity which made
a man like Mast pretend sometimes to be the
greatest of sinners. Sir John had a sufficiency
of physical courage for ordinary uses, but
Pryce had shown himself on many occasions
to be absolutely reckless of his own life. This
had occurred not only in such forms of sport
as the island afforded, but more frequently in
the practice of his science; the island offered
drugs that were not in the pharmacopœia, and
Pryce, in his enthusiastic study of them, did not
stop short at experiments upon himself. It
was a great thing, Sir John felt, to have an
able and qualified doctor in the club, and with
his customary generosity he suggested that a
consignment of drugs and apparatus from
London for the doctor should be charged to the
club account. Pryce replied that his little
box of rubbish was paid for already, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The present crisis in the club’s affairs
brought out strongly the changes in Sir John’s
character. The cornered rat was showing
fight. Sir John contemplated the destruction
of the <i>Snowflake</i> and all aboard her without
the faintest feeling of remorse. But Pryce’s
careless offer to undertake the work did not
satisfy him.</p>

<p>The man who scuttled the <i>Snowflake</i> in mid-ocean
would probably be committing suicide;
Sir John had no doubt about that. And
Pryce was too valuable to lose. Why, Sir
John himself might be taken ill at any time.
There was a queer form of island fever, as to
which he was nervous. The King himself had
suffered from it.</p>

<p>And on further consideration Sir John
doubted the feasibility of the scheme. By
this time Lechworthy probably knew all about
the Exiles’ Club, and would see for himself
the danger that he represented to them; Bassett’s
attempt to murder him would have
illuminated the question. Under the circumstances
it was unlikely that he would allow
any member of the club on board the <i>Snowflake</i>,
unless possibly his religious feelings were
involved and that member played the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of a repentant and converted sinner. And
Sir John knew that Pryce would not do that.</p>

<p>“We’ll think about it, Pryce,” he said
finally. “There may be some other way.
Something may turn up.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>The King’s house was built bungalow
fashion. The rooms were large and
lofty, and opened on to a broad verandah;
the furniture was scanty but sufficient, and
much of it was of native workmanship; only
in the bedrooms did the Auckland-imported
suites reign supreme. The walls were hung
with printed cloths or matting woven in
intricate and elaborate designs. In every
room banks of flowers gave audacious but
splendid colour, and young palms yielded a
cool green relief. The garden was not less
lovely because many of its natural features
had been left unaltered. The little stream
that leaped from the crag into the pool twelve
feet below had fallen, just there and just so,
long before the exiles had come to Faloo, long
before the King’s grandfather had died&mdash;of
alcohol and excessive passions. The white
paths curved and twisted through innumerable
shrubberies, and lost themselves in deep cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shade. Here and there were broad stretches
of tufty unmown grass, and long hedges of
hibiscus aflame with scarlet.</p>

<p>Hilda was principally fascinated by all that
was native. The extremely fine work of the
matting on the walls interested her, the great
garden enthralled her. To Tiva and Ioia it
was more remarkable that for the first time
in their lives they had seen themselves reflected
in a full-length mirror; this wonder of civilisation
adorned the wardrobe in Hilda’s room.
Mr Lechworthy, attended by King Smith,
noted with great satisfaction that his room
possessed a spring mattress and a tin bath, and
that his Bible, his camera and his clothes had
arrived safely. Even as he examined them
a letter was handed to him which a messenger
from the Exiles’ Club had just brought. It
was an agonised letter from Bassett, repeating
that he had fired by accident, proclaiming the
deepest repentance for his past life, expressing
his desire to return with Lechworthy to England
and there to stand his trial. Lechworthy
handed it to King Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the King, when he had read it.
“There is no truth in it at all.”</p>

<p>“None, I am afraid. I note his account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the accident varies in one particular from what
he said before.”</p>

<p>“There was no accident. I saw the man’s
hands.”</p>

<p>“And yet, sir, I ask you once more to give
me that man’s life. I cannot stand the idea
of a British subject being executed like this&mdash;at
a few hours’ notice, without trial, guilty in
many ways but not of the capital offence. He
may not be fit to live but he is not fit to
die.”</p>

<p>“Great Britain has nothing to do here; if
she had Bassett would not be here.”</p>

<p>“True enough, sir. I know it. I’m not
saying that he is not amenable to the law of
this island, made and administered by yourself.
I am merely, as your guest, asking for a
favour. How can I dine with you to-night,
smoke my pipe and have my talk with you in
peace, if I know this poor wretch is perhaps
at that very hour being executed?”</p>

<p>King Smith smiled. “Very well,” he said.
“To-night I am going to ask you to save the
lives of many of my race&mdash;I might even say
the race itself. This worthless thing&mdash;this
Bassett&mdash;I will give you. You will take him
home and see that he stands his trial?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly. On that I insist. He must
take his punishment.”</p>

<p>“Write to him that you have saved his life,
but that this is conditional on his surrendering
to the man who will await him at the gates
of the club enclosure some time before midnight.
He can bring his personal belongings
with him; you see I give him time to get his
things together, and to clear up his business
as secretary of the club. You may say further
that he will not be ill-treated, but that he will
be kept in custody until you choose to sail.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, from the bottom of my
heart. You have taken a great weight off
my mind. I will write to him precisely in
those terms. May I have a messenger?”</p>

<p>“There are many men here,” said the King,
“and they are here only as your servants, to
go where you like and to do what you wish.
They understand that.”</p>

<p>The King was deep in thought as he drove
back to his business residence on the beach.
There he became busy. He remembered to
send up to his big house the preserved asparagus
which would be wanted for dinner. He
examined with care a still that was then
working. He saw the overseer from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
plantations inland. He calculated the number
of bags of copra that would be ready for his
next schooner. He settled a dispute between
two natives as to the ownership of a goat.
But he gave no orders for a man to be at the
gates of the club enclosure shortly before
midnight, nor did he give, nor had he given,
any orders whatever about Bassett.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, up at the palace, Tiva, Ioia
and Hilda explored the garden, and the native
girls discovered with joy the wide pool into
which the waterfall plashed. They begged
Hilda to come for a swim with them. The idea
was certainly alluring, but for two reasons
Hilda demurred. One was the presence of a
patrol of athletic-looking natives with rifles
on their shoulders, but this reason was disposed
of at once.</p>

<p>“We speak him,” cooed Tiva. “He go
pretty dam quick.” And it was so.</p>

<p>The other reason vanished before the resources
of the rather fantastic wardrobe which
Ioia had brought with her. Two hours later
Hilda sat on the verandah with her wet hair
loose. She had considered herself fairly expert
in the water, but Tiva and Ioia quite eclipsed
her; there had seemed to be absolutely nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
which they could not do, and they did everything
with the most beautiful ease and grace.
Hilda rather wished she had been a sculptor.
The two water-nymphs now sat at her feet&mdash;Tiva
in a loose salmon-coloured robe, with a
gold bangle on one arm, and Ioia in a similar
robe of olive-green surmounted by a barbarous
kimono. The bangle and the kimono were
Hilda’s gifts. The hurricane had passed as
quickly as it had come, and far away before
her Hilda could see a sea of marvellous
sapphire, foam-streaked, trying to be good
again.</p>

<p>Lechworthy spent much of his time that
afternoon in his room alone. Then he roamed
the garden, camera in hand. He took three
snapshots of the armed patrol, and he took
them all on the same section of film. But,
not yet aware of this little mistake, he was
in a placid and even sunny temper when he
came on to the verandah for tea. Tiva and
Ioia, commanded by Hilda, took tea with
them; Ioia tried most things, including tea-leaves,
which she ate with moderation but
with apparent enjoyment. Then the two
sang&mdash;a beautiful voice and a correct ear are
part of the island girl’s natural inheritance&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Hilda and her uncle listened. The song
was in the native tongue and for the most
part improvised, and perhaps it was just as
well that the listeners did not understand it.
It was wholly in praise of Hilda, but it praised
her with a wealth of detail unusual in European
eulogies.</p>

<p>Bassett at the Exiles’ Club received Lechworthy’s
reply to his letter shortly after the
luncheon hour. Bassett himself was unable
to eat luncheon; he was sick with fear. He
grew worse every hour. His nerves had
broken down. Sir John and Dr Soames Pryce
had taken all possible means to safeguard
Bassett’s life, for that night at any rate.
Every member in whom reliance could be
placed was ready to help. From ten to twelve
Bassett was to remain in the secretary’s room.
There would be a guard outside both window
and door. All over the club garden a watch
would be kept. To protect him from poison
his food and drink were to be tasted by native
servants. Preparations were made to deal
with any sudden outbreak of fire.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pull yourself together a little?”
said Dr Pryce, utterly weary of him.</p>

<p>“Everything you’ve done’s no good,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Bassett. “I know King Smith, and he does
what he says. You can’t stop him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Bassett,” said Sir John.
“King Smith is a man and he cannot do
miracles. You probably will never be safer
in your life than you will be to-night. For
that matter, your letter to Lechworthy may
get you off altogether.”</p>

<p>Bassett began to weep. He was a humiliating,
distressing, repellent spectacle. Dr
Soames Pryce ordered brandy to be brought,
and forced him to take a stiff dose.</p>

<p>He then became sullen and morose. He said
that he wished he had not taken the brandy.
Drink was the curse of more than half the men
in the club, and he thanked God he had never
given way to it. Then he became suspicious
of the revolver which had been given him.
How was he to know it was all right? Finally
he exchanged weapons with Sir John.</p>

<p>The arrival of the letter from Lechworthy
did nothing to inspirit him. He read it aloud.</p>

<p>“There you are, you see,” said Sir John.
“Sentence commuted. Aren’t you ashamed
of yourself for behaving in this way? I told
you Lechworthy would get you off.”</p>

<p>“Get me off?” said Bassett. “Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
mean to say you can’t see that this thing’s a
trap? A little before midnight I’m to hand
myself over to some man at the gates. He
takes me away. Oh, yes! Good-bye all!
How long afterwards do you suppose I shall
be alive?”</p>

<p>“Do you think Lechworthy would trap
you in that way?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? He’s got no particular
reason to love me, has he? But what’s
most likely is that Lechworthy himself has
been deceived by King Smith.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do, Bassett. The deceit would
be found out next day. King Smith, on the
contrary, is most anxious to do all that he can
to please Lechworthy and to win him over.
What do you think, Pryce?”</p>

<p>“That is so. The letter is quite genuine.
Bassett will hand himself over to the man,
<span class="lock">and&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I will not,” screamed Bassett.</p>

<p>“You will,” said Pryce. “You will be
made to do it. You see the situation that
way, Sweetling, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. Listen to me, Bassett.
You have asked the King to spare your life,
and offered in return to hand yourself over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Lechworthy. He spares your life, and imposes
a condition which amounts to what you
offered&mdash;he is merely making certain that you
do hand yourself over to Lechworthy. What
do you think will happen when the King finds
that he has been fooled and that you have
broken your word? My friend, in that case
he would get you, even if it were necessary to
set all the natives on us to-night, as he could
do. He would get you, and I fancy he would
adopt barbarous ways of killing you. Therefore,
you will be at the gates shortly before
midnight&mdash;even if you have to be carried
there.”</p>

<p>“It comes to this,” said Bassett, “that I’m
betrayed by you two.” His shoulders shook,
the nails of his yellow hands beat the table
convulsively, his thin lips twitched sideways
and upwards.</p>

<p>“Bassett,” said Dr Soames Pryce, “try to
behave a little more like a man, won’t you?
This sort of show isn’t&mdash;it’s not very pretty,
you know. I give you my word of honour
that I believe your life’s safe if you’ll only do
what the King tells you. You’ll have to go
on board the <i>Snowflake</i>, of course, but you’ll
get a chance to give Lechworthy the slip long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
before he gets to England. Then you’ll come
back here&mdash;you’ve got the money to do it with.
If it’s any consolation to you, I may tell you
that I shall probably be on the schooner
myself&mdash;private business of my own&mdash;and I’ll
see that you get your opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You on board too? How? What business
do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I think I said private business of my
own.”</p>

<p>“I see. Something I’m not to know about.
Another conspiracy against me, eh? Here,
give me that brandy.” He nearly filled his
tumbler with it, and drank it in quick, excited
ugly gulps. He rose to his feet and shook a
skinny fist. “You two fools! Do you think
I can’t see? Smith has bought you. All the
jabber about protecting me was a farce, and
Lechworthy’s letter was a put-up thing between
you. If I go, I die. If I stay, I die. Pretty
thing, ain’t it? You swindled me over the
lizards, Pryce, and thought I didn’t know.
But, my God, I haven’t got a friend, and I
know that! You needn’t look so angry, Sir
John. You’ve been bowled out before. You’re
used to it. Well, all right. I go to-night.
Good-bye all! I’m off to my own room&mdash;special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
leave from King Smith to pack the
shirts I’ll never wear. Good-bye! We’ll meet
in hell.”</p>

<p>He flung himself out of the room, across the
hall, and up the stairs. Lord Charles Baringstoke
was seated in the hall, drinking through
a straw a mixture of <i>crême-de-menthe</i> and
crushed ice. He observed Mr Bassett, and he
turned to Mr Sainton&mdash;the member who was
paying for the drinks.</p>

<p>“See our Mr damned Bassett? Well, you
know, I ain’t the champion gold cup at the
beauty show myself, but I never did know anyone
look quite so blessed ugly as that chap
does. Might use him to test iron girders, eh?
Mean he might grin at them, and if they’d
stand that, they’d stand anything.”</p>

<p>In the room which Bassett had just left
Sir John Sweetling controlled his rage with
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Look here, Pryce,” said Sir John. “We’ve
done the best we can for the man, but this lets
me out. If I see him again before he goes I&mdash;I
can’t answer for what will happen.”</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce rolled a cigarette. “The
beauty of being a doctor,” he said, “is that
you can’t lose your wool with your case&mdash;whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
he, or she, does or says. Bassett,
under pressure, has become a case. And, as
I don’t think it safe to leave him alone, I’ll
hop upstairs after him. See you presently.”</p>

<p>On the stairs Dr Pryce heard the report of a
revolver. He arrived just ten seconds too
late.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The King and Mr Lechworthy dined alone
that night. Hilda discovered, rather suddenly,
that she was absolutely worn out with the
long day. Tiva and Ioia, watching her, spoke
one or two sentences together in the native
tongue. Then Tiva explained to Hilda in
English that she and Ioia had spread their
sleeping-mats on the verandah just against
Hilda’s window. If Hilda wanted them at
any time in the night she had only to go to the
window and speak, and they would be with
her at once. Hilda thanked them, but she
was sure she would not need them. She left
with her uncle her apologies to the King.</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy’s dress was just precisely
what he would have worn in the evening in
London. The King wore a tropical evening
suit of white drill; he had ridden up from the
office and changed his clothes at the palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
The two men dined early&mdash;a brief and tasteful
dinner composed principally of native dishes.
And then Lechworthy filled his pipe, and they
took their coffee on the verandah, and talked
long and seriously.</p>

<p>It was of the death of the native races that
the King spoke&mdash;and of his own ambition, that
Faloo should become a refuge for them from
the deadly effects of civilisation, that in the
future no white man should ever be allowed
to set foot there. Let Great Britain undertake
just that work of protection and close the
island definitely to all but the natives. Let
her say that neither British nor French nor
German, nor any other white man, might land
there. King Smith said that he knew little of
the conditions that might be demanded, but if
Great Britain wished him to renounce his
title of King he would resign it willingly;
if tribute were wanted, he would see that it
was paid punctually. All he asked was Great
Britain’s guarantee that in Faloo the island
people should be left absolutely to themselves,
to live their own life in the old way, and so to
escape the racial destruction that was coming
swiftly upon them.</p>

<p>He laid before Lechworthy the pictorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
evidence of travellers and the unimpassioned
figures of the statistics. Everywhere in the
islands, as civilisation advanced, the native
race died out. The King made no attack upon
civilisation, wasted no time in idle epigrams.
Civilisation might have all the merits and all
the advantages, but it had been proved in cold
history that the island races could not accept
it. In childish and rather pathetic good-will
they had tried to accept it, and in consequence
many had died out and the rest were dying.</p>

<p>It was not merely a question of drink. It
was true, of course, that alcohol, which harmed
the habituated European, quickly demoralised
and killed the unhabituated islanders. But
there was hardly a part of civilisation that did
not help to kill him. Civilisation called him
from the open air into houses where he was
poisoned and stifled. It clothed his partial
nakedness with European stuffs and pneumonia
followed. It gave him things to learn for
which his mind was unfit, and he became
obtuse and devitalised. Nature had spared
him and put him in places where food and such
shelter as he needed might be had free or for
a minimum of labour; civilisation put a stress
upon him and paid him in luxuries that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
bad for him. Tinned meat and multiplication
tables, gin and geography, feather beds and
tight boots, worry and hypocrisy, everything
worked together for bad for the islander.
Civilisation increased his needs and sapped his
powers. He went down, down inevitably, in
his struggle with it.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said Lechworthy. “What
you say is true; I have heard something of this
before, though far less than you have told me.
But your own case hardly supports your argument.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I admit that I am quite exceptional.
Heredity may have something to
do with it. There is a legend of white blood
in my family, a long way back. It may be so
or it may not&mdash;such inter-marriages do not
generally have a good result. But my grandfather
died of drink, and my father was a very
great friend of the missionaries. So perhaps
I was born&mdash;what is the word?&mdash;yes, perhaps
I was born immune. There are no missionaries
here now, except the two French priests, and
they do nothing; you see, they have grown old
and very, very fat.”</p>

<p>“Your father then&mdash;he was a convert?”</p>

<p>“The missionaries thought so, and he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
what they liked; you see, he was a good friend
to them, and they taught him. My father
could read English, and he spoke it too, but
not very correctly. He was a kind man, but
he was not very much converted, I think.
He began to teach me when I was quite young,
and always I wanted to learn more. It was
he who showed me what the white man is doing
in these islands. So it is very many years
since I first thought that Faloo is not a great
island, and had been left over, and perhaps I
might in time secure it so that it should be the
last home of my people, lest they all died.
And I have gone on thinking it always; it is
for that that I have done good and also bad
things.”</p>

<p>“But you speak English remarkably, sir.
You did not learn it from your father alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. For nearly ten years the Exiles’
Club has been here, and I have been the friend
of the white men just as my father in his time
was the friend of the missionaries. The men
of the Exiles’ Club came to me, and there was
always whisky and cigars and whatever they
wanted. So they would sit and talk with me.
That Mr Cyril Mast came very often. Most
days he is very bad and also drunken. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he is beautifully educated, and he told me
much about England. Sometimes Sir John
Sweetling, who started the club, would talk
about your financial world, though it was
mostly on our joint business he came to see me.
This Bassett also talked. Even Lord Charles
<span class="lock">Baringstoke&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“What? Is that young scamp here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and even from him I have learned
something. But the best man of all of them
is Dr Soames Pryce. He is very able and he is
different from the others. When I was ill
with an island fever he came to see me and
he gave me medicines, and very soon I was well
again. But when I would have paid him he
told me to go to the devil. I think it was
because he has sometimes drunk whisky with
me, but not so often as I should like, for I
think he knows very much, and he is the only
one whose word I altogether believe.”</p>

<p>So far Mr Lechworthy had expressed no
opinion; he was rather miserly with expression
until he had well weighed his subject.
But he had already formed his opinions.
Firstly, the King was simple and sincere. He
spoke plainly and without hypocrisy. He had
not shirked the fact that his father was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
really converted to Christianity, or that he
himself had been a boon companion of these
blackguards at the Exiles’ Club. He had
never emphasised the point that he wanted
nothing for himself and everything for his
people; he had treated this attitude as a
matter of course, and, had not dwelt upon it.
Secondly, the project of Faloo for the people of
Faloo, with their independence supported by
Great Britain, appealed to him greatly. We
had done enough grabbing for unworthy ends.
We had become a byword in that respect.
It was a great thing to save a race; it was an
idea which might arouse an enthusiasm, and
that in its turn might become useful in practical
politics. The missionary question presented
to his mind the only difficulty at present.
However, he would hear the whole story.</p>

<p>The next chapter of that story dealt with
Smith’s start as a trader. It went back to the
time of Sir John Sweetling’s arrival at Faloo;
two other white men had followed him there
within the year. He narrated his dealings
with Sir John and with the syndicate which
was subsequently formed. The financial control
of the business was practically shifted to
a distant island, where there was a bank with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a cast-iron method and a Commissioner who
could enforce agreements. The King, young
and inexperienced, had signed the instructions
to the bank and had signed the iniquitous
agreements. He had put the noose on his own
neck.</p>

<p>But one hold on his partners he retained, or
the noose would have been drawn tight long
before. They lived at Faloo, and there was
probably no other part of the globe where they
could have lived with the same safety and
comfort. They were in consequence largely
dependent on the King of Faloo; he alone could
control the natives. Consequently, concessions
were made to him on points where he had insisted.
The dangerous but remunerative contraband
trade had been a case in point; he
had refused to allow any native of Faloo to
buy liquor; he had even safeguarded the
native servants employed at the Exiles’ Club.
After one week&mdash;in which the King had left
the club without any native servants at all&mdash;its
members learned wisdom.</p>

<p>In the actual conduct of the business he had
not had to complain of much interference.
He was free to settle all the details of it and
to do all the work of it. It was called his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
business&mdash;not their business. But his partners’
veto came in from time to time, and gradually
he had realised that he was held back. Trade
was not to be extended. The reef was not to
be opened up. He was never to be rich enough
to buy out his own partners and to be independent
of them. Here and there he could
tempt one of the investors by an appeal to his
cupidity&mdash;Bassett had been such a man. But
the more important interest, represented by
Sir John, had stuck always to the same policy&mdash;to
keep a control over King Smith, and to
prevent Faloo from developing a trade of
sufficient importance to attract outside
attention. For instance, the amount of copra
that might be exported was not regulated by
what could be produced and sold, but by a
decision of the King’s partners; and they had
no wish to bring the great soap-making firms
down on Faloo.</p>

<p>And then the idea had come to him that he
might be able to split up the white men, create
differences among them, and perhaps form a
party of his own. It was with this view that
he had persuaded some of them to support his
candidature for membership of the Exiles’
Club, and had lent money to some of the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>mittance
men and had refused it to others.
“And perhaps I might have done something
with that, but in the meanwhile, without intending
it, the white men have split up my
own people. There is now a certain number
of natives who are acting without any order
from me, and even against my order. They
have no hostility towards me, and they act
secretly because they are all afraid of me.
Their aim is to kill all the white men on the
island. They killed one last night&mdash;I buried
him early this morning. I will tell you how
that has come about.” And the King narrated,
with more detail than need be given here, the
trouble about the native women.</p>

<p>“I have only kept my people in hand up to
this point by promising them that a day should
come when not one white man would be left on
the island if only they would be patient. If
they used violence, then my plans would be
spoiled&mdash;they would be punished&mdash;the men-of-war
would come&mdash;the whole island would fall
into the white man’s hands. And, Mr Lechworthy,
even if you had not come I should have
kept my word, for when a man wants only one
thing, and wants it very badly, he must get it
in the end. But I no longer have the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of my people in hand. There must be some&mdash;I
think they are few&mdash;who have not enough
patience. I cannot blame them in my heart,
although as soon as I find them I shall kill
them. I cannot, I say, blame them in my
heart, for there are wrongs which drive a
man mad, and these are just the wrongs of
which the white men have been guilty. That
then is the position here&mdash;a section of my
people is in secret rebellion against me, and it
is to the Exiles’ Club that I owe this. And
look&mdash;I have but to give one brief order, and
in an hour the club would be burned to the
ground and every white man in it would be
murdered. There are times when I have been
tempted. But I always knew that it was not
so that I should make the Faloo of my dreams&mdash;not
in that way that I should gain the
friendship and the help&mdash;the indispensable
help&mdash;of Great Britain.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, drank from the long
glass before him, and lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>“There is the story, Mr Lechworthy. I
have worked for a good thing, but it is as I
said: I have used a bad implement and it has
hurt my hand, and perhaps I must burn the
wound with a little gunpowder before it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
be whole again. You can save us all, if you
will. You are a politician and a friend of
politicians of high Cabinet rank. You own a
newspaper. You can arouse public feeling,
and you can direct it. You know how these
things are managed. Perhaps to-morrow you
will decide. To-night I cannot remain much
longer for I have to fetch this man Bassett&mdash;if
he is still there.”</p>

<p>“If he is still there?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He is a suspicious man and his
nerves are very feeble. He may have distrusted
your letter. He may have run away.
He may have&mdash;anything may have happened.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, I have done what I could.
There is one little point which I would mention
to-night. These agreements with your
partners are so unjust, and contain such
evidence of bad faith, that I think I could get
them set aside. But all that would take time,
and there is a quicker way. The terms on
which you can buy them out are unfair and
extravagant, but even so the amount of capital
involved is&mdash;well&mdash;it is not to me a very large
sum. I offer to buy them out and to become
your one partner in their place. I wish to do
this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“I accept it with gratitude,” said the King,
“provided that you understand this: if ever
Faloo is closed, except to its own people, the
trade will stop absolutely. It would then be
unnecessary and a source of danger. The
island itself provides all that a native
wants.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Lechworthy, “I have no
objection. My capital would then be returned
to me. I am anxious to make it possible for
you to drop&mdash;the implement that has hurt your
hand. And as for the rest, I can tell you my
position in a few words. I am ready to help
you by all the means in my power; this idea
of the refuge for the race, the island where
it may recuperate itself, appeals to me immensely,
and I think I can make some political
use of it too. But, sir, I have my conscience.
I may shut the door against the white man and
his dangerous civilisation, but I dare not shut
it against the gospel of Christ. There, we
will speak of this to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall be here early in the morning.
Good-night, Mr Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>At five minutes to twelve the King reined
in his horse at the gates of the club compound.
Dr Soames Pryce stood there alone. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
too dark to see the expression of his face, but
his voice sounded sardonic.</p>

<p>“You have come for your prisoner, King
Smith?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“He has escaped you. He shot himself
this afternoon. You found the man’s breaking-point
all right. Do you want evidence of
his death?”</p>

<p>“I take your word for it. You know, I
suppose, that he had his chance of life. My
guest, Mr Lechworthy, wrote a <span class="lock">letter&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I know. And the only man who
disbelieved in the letter was Bassett. He
disbelieved in everybody and everything.
Extreme fear had made him insane. By the
way, it was I who stopped your election to
this club, and now I want you to do me a
kindness. Damned awkward, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The King smiled. “That is not the only
association you have had with me. What is
it you want?”</p>

<p>“I remember no other association. Oh, yes,
I gave you a few pills once, didn’t I? Well,
I can tell you what I want anyhow. The
fact is that this place is becoming a bit too
hot for my simple tastes, and I want to clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
out. Duncombe’s missing; we’ve had men
out all day looking for him and he can’t be
found.”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with that.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. I don’t accuse you. Still, it
happened. Bassett was sentenced and reprieved,
and ended by shooting himself.
Cyril Mast is boozing himself mad; we are
trying to sober him down enough to read the
service over Bassett. Every night we find
natives, who’ve got no business here, skulking
about this place. It’s possible that some of
them will hurt themselves. The pot’ll boil
over presently, and there will be general hell.
I’m a quiet man, and I’d sooner be away. I
wish you’d put in a word for me to this Mr
Lechworthy. If he had room for Bassett he’s
got room for me. I’ll pay my passage, or
work it as doctor or anything else, whichever
he likes. You might put in a word for me.”</p>

<p>“But why bother Lechworthy? One of
our own boats will be going out again in a few
days’ time.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. If I wanted to be poisoned
with the stink of copra, and eaten alive with
cockroaches, I’d go by it. The <i>Snowflake’s</i> a
sound clean boat, and I prefer it. The inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
will drop out of your schooner one of these
days. She’s all right for trade, but she’s slow,
rotten and nasty.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the King. “I’ll speak
to him about it. But of course the decision
will rest with him.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Thanks very much.”</p>

<p>They said good-night and parted, the King
riding on to the office on the beach, and Dr
Pryce returning to Sir John in the club.</p>

<p>“How goes it?” asked Pryce.</p>

<p>“Mast is sober now, but he’s pretty shaky.
It seems that his bit of a row with Bassett is
disturbing him, and he’s been weeping. I
say, Pryce, our men are simply going to pap.”</p>

<p>“Everything else ready for the burial?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll give Mast one stiff peg to steady
him, and we’ll start away. By the way, it
was as I thought, it was the King himself
who came to the gate.”</p>

<p>“Then you spoke about the <i>Snowflake</i>?”</p>

<p>“Of course. He’ll see Lechworthy about
it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he smells a rat?”</p>

<p>“There are some men who smell rats and
then shout about it, and they don’t generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
make fortunes as rat-catchers. Smith’s not
that sort.”</p>

<p>“You mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I don’t know whether he
suspects or not. I should imagine that he’s
watching out, and so am I, which makes it
quite interesting. Now I’ll go and see if I
can straighten Mast’s backbone a bit.”</p>

<p>The King certainly had not accepted Pryce’s
statement that he was a quiet man and wished
to run away from fear of a native uprising;
but Pryce might have had other reasons of
which he did not wish to speak, and the real
reason did not occur to the King at all. But
he was suspicious and on his guard. He had
very much to think of and many questions to
ask himself. What line would Sir John take
when he found that he and the other partners
were to be bought out? Would Lechworthy
be obstinate on the question of white missionaries
for Faloo? If this were arranged, would
Lechworthy be able to bring the scheme to a
successful issue? Who was it that had
murdered Duncombe?</p>

<p>To this last question the King had a simple
means of finding the answer. Knowing the
native mind as he did, he knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
murderer would be driven to make some
demonstration of triumph and satisfied
revenge. He would do it secretly, probably
very late at night, but he would find himself
driven to do it. Stealthily and on foot the
King went from one native house to another,
wherever he suspected the criminal might
possibly be.</p>

<p>It was some hours later that he stood outside
a little shanty and listened to the man who was
singing within. The singer was drunk&mdash;drunk
on methylated spirits stolen from the stores
of the Exiles’ Club. The King entered.</p>

<p>It was just at this time that away at the
palace Hilda Auriol managed to raise herself
a little in bed. “Tiva! Ioia!” she called
and fell back again. In an instant the two
girls entered through the windows from the
verandah.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think I am very ill,” moaned Hilda.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>Bassett was buried by lantern-light a
little after one in the morning in a far
corner of the club grounds. His was the
fourth grave there, and not one of the four
men had died in his bed. The Rev. Cyril
Mast read the service sonorously, with dignity
and self-control, for Soames Pryce had seen to
him, and Soames Pryce was a clever doctor.
The roughly-made coffin&mdash;a wooden framework
with thick mats stretched over it&mdash;was
borne by members of the club, and it was
they who had dug the grave and afterwards
filled it in. No native had ever been allowed
to have anything to do with the interment of a
white man.</p>

<p>Most of the members were present at the
funeral, but not all. Lord Charles Baringstoke
was not there, but he expressed his regrets
afterwards, leaning against the wall in the
card-room with a cigarette in one side of his
loose mouth.</p>

<p>“I’d always meant to see the beggar planted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
but, you see, I didn’t know when the thing was
going to start. So we’d one rubber to fill in
time. Then, just when the lights went past
the window, we were game and twenty-eight,
and it looked like our only being five minutes
late anyhow; but I got my spades doubled
and the little slam up against me, and then
they made an odd trick in hearts, and we were
finally bust on a dam-silly no-trumper of my
partner’s. Still, I’m sorry you know, though
it couldn’t be helped. Everybody going to
bed? One more little drink&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>Already on the screen in the hall there was
a notice calling an emergency meeting of the
members in the afternoon for the election of
an honorary secretary who would also be a
member of the committee. Neither Pryce
nor Mast had cared to undertake the secretarial
work.</p>

<p>Standing by the screen, Sir John Sweetling,
in conversation with some of the more responsible
members of the club, pronounced
the panegyric upon Bassett. “He never, or
very rarely, drank; he liked business, and he
kept the books well.” Sir John paused a
moment in thought, and added, “And he
wrote an excellent hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“And paid nodings for it,” said round-eyed
Mr Mandelbaum. “But zen it put him in ze
know.”</p>

<p>It was long before Sir John could get any
sleep that night. His mind was still active
and anxious. The old questions still bothered
him. What compact, if any, had been made
between King Smith and Lechworthy? Was
it just possible that the King had not given
the Exiles’ Club away? If he had, which
seemed almost certain, would Pryce be able
to carry out what he had undertaken? Would
Pryce be able to save himself when the <i>Snowflake</i>
was scuttled or burned? And then there
were many worries in connection with the
club. Who could be found to take Bassett’s
place? What could be done about Cyril
Mast, whose folly was the cause of all that had
happened? Some advantage might be taken
of his repentance.</p>

<p>It seemed to Sir John that he had only been
asleep for a few minutes when he was awakened
by a loud knock at his door. It was just daylight.
Sir John was rather startled. He
glanced at his revolver on the table by his
bedside and shouted “Come in.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to disturb you,” said Dr Pryce, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he entered. He was dressed, and he sat down
and laced his boots as he talked. “But I’ve
got to be off. A letter was brought to me
ten minutes ago from Lechworthy. His niece
is ill&mdash;seriously ill, I should say, and he wants
me at once. He seems to have sent the letter
through the King&mdash;at any rate Smith’s waiting
for me in a buggy outside.”</p>

<p>Sir John was wide awake and out of bed
by now. He thrust his feet into a pair of soft
red leather slippers. He was quite a good
figure of a man, but his tendency to corpulence
was more noticeable in his yellow silk pyjamas,
and one gets untidy at night. “But this is a
new move, Pryce,” he said. “This secures
your passage on the <i>Snowflake</i>.” He peered
into the looking-glass and used two hairbrushes
quickly. Then he suddenly wheeled
round, with the brushes still in his hands.
“By God! it settles everything. You needn’t
go near the <i>Snowflake</i>. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Thought you’d come to it. You mean
that I poison the girl and her uncle. Smith
has to come back to us because he has no one
else. The skipper and crew will know nothing,
and will be told a tale. That’s it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course, though it needn’t be put quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
like that. The best of doctors cannot save
every patient. Lechworthy would be distracted,
and a sleeping-draught might be
necessary&mdash;and a mistake might occur. That’s
the way I’m going to put it&mdash;to Smith, to the
men here, to everybody. You can trust me.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. But you’re in too much of
a hurry. I’m not going to do it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Because you’re called in as a
doctor? Man, our lives are at stake. Let’s
be frank. I won’t face a trial and penal
servitude to follow. Would you? You were
ready to do much worse than this. It isn’t
a time <span class="lock">for&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I know,” said the doctor. He had finished
with his boots now, and stood upright. “It’s
not exactly a point of professional etiquette.
The thing simply isn’t sport. It’s too easy
and too dirty.”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t reasonable. You’re willing
to sink the <i>Snowflake</i> and&mdash;and all that’s
implied in that.”</p>

<p>“Willing to try. The scuttling of a
schooner is not too easy. Teetotal millionaires
can afford luxuries, and you may bet
there’s a good sober skipper and a picked crew
on board the <i>Snowflake</i>. They will be awake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
If I were caught cutting a pipe, or fooling with
the sea-cocks, or doing something surgical
to the boats, I think&mdash;well, objections would
be raised. Also, the problem of the one
survivor takes some thinking out. It’s likely
there would be too many survivors or none at
all. It’s blackguardly enough, but still there
is an element of risk about it. As for the
other thing, well, to cut it short, I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Then I must leave it,” said Sir John. “I
think you’re missing a chance, but that can’t
be helped. When do you return?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say. To-night perhaps, if the
patient doesn’t need me. Well, good-bye,
Sweetling. Get ’em to elect Hanson secretary
if you can. If I can’t come I’ll write.”</p>

<p>Sir John crept back again into bed. He did
not mean to break with Pryce, and he had
shown less anger than he felt. He was not
really surprised at Pryce’s prompt and definite
refusal. He had dealt with many bad men&mdash;some
worse than the doctor&mdash;and he was a
bad man himself; and he had come constantly
on the bad thing that the bad man would not
do. He had found the distorted sense of
honour in men who had done some dishonourable
things. He had found generosity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
thieves and tender-heartedness in a murderer.
Even as the good sometimes fall, so do the bad
sometimes rise.</p>

<p>And, after all, the summons of Dr Pryce
to the palace to attend Lechworthy’s niece was
all to the good. He would be in the position
of a spy in the enemy’s camp. Probably, by
the evening, he would return with news of the
relations of Lechworthy and the King. Uncertainties
would be cleared up, and it would
be easier to see what to do. And yet another
point occurred to Sir John. Suppose that
Pryce saved the life of Lechworthy’s niece,
Lechworthy’s gratitude would be unbounded,
and he would be ready to do anything to show
it. Pryce would refuse money, but he might
ask Lechworthy to leave the Exiles’ Club
alone, to refrain from policeman’s work,
to do nothing which would give the secret
away. Thus thinking, Sir John fell asleep
again.</p>

<p>He rose late, breakfasted in his room, and
then sought out the Rev. Cyril Mast.</p>

<p>“I want you,” said Sir John. “Pryce
has been called away, and we are the only two
on the committee for the moment. Come to
the secretary’s room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mast, dejectedly, and
followed him.</p>

<p>The two sat at the table facing one another.
Mast’s red-rimmed eyes fell on the little glass
of small shot with which Bassett had been
wont to clean his pens. He could recall the
nervous jabbing movement of Bassett’s hand as
he did it. Bassett’s three cork penholders
lay in a tray before him.</p>

<p>“You can say what you like,” said Mast.
“Whatever you say I deserve it. I ought
never to have brought the Lechworthys here.
I couldn’t foresee that Bassett would come
out and Lechworthy would recognise him.
It was all wrong, though.”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“Do you never feel sometimes that you’d
like to talk to a few decent people who didn’t
know your history? I’ve been nearly mad.
And&mdash;well, it was you who began it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And what had I got to do with
it?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t mean it, and you’ll probably
laugh at it. It was about a fortnight ago, and
we’d just finished a committee meeting after
dinner. There were Pryce, Bassett, you and
I sitting out on the verandah. Bassett kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
jigging about in a wicker chair that squeaked
horribly, and you said you’d give us some
better music than that, you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember. What about it?”</p>

<p>“You pulled out that swagger presentation
watch of yours&mdash;the one that plays the tunes&mdash;and
set it going. The night was quite still,
and I sat listening to the tinky-tink of ‘Home,
sweet Home.’ That brought back Histon
Boys to my mind&mdash;village where I was, you
know. Old chaps hobbling out of church, bad
with rheumatism; they used to touch their
hats to me then. They didn’t know. I was
welcome anywhere in the village. I dined
with the farmers and played tennis with their
pretty daughters. People walked in from the
next village, three miles away, to hear me
preach on Sunday evenings. Yes, it won’t
seem much to you, but I’ve lost it all, and I
can never have it again or anything like it.
Why, if I showed myself in Histon Boys now,
they’d set their dogs on me. That infernal
tune made me think, and thinking drove me
mad.”</p>

<p>“I’m not concerned with your sins, Mr
Mast. Being a parson you repent ’em, and
being what you are, you repeat ’em. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
spend your time in alternate sobbing and
soaking. But I’m concerned with your follies,
because they’re dangerous. You showed
yourself a dangerous fool in the matter of the
native women. You’ve showed yourself still
more dangerous in bringing Lechworthy here.
Lechworthy’s hand-in-glove with the King.
Lechworthy may sail for home with a list of
our names in his pocket-book.”</p>

<p>“I realise all that,” said Mast. “If there’s
anything I can do about Lechworthy I’ll do it.
I don’t care what it is.”</p>

<p>“Remember you’ve said that. I may take
you at your word later. At present that
matter is in the hands of a stronger man than
you are. Lechworthy’s niece is ill, and Dr
Pryce is attending her. Something may be
worked that way.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? Well, there are more ways
than one of paying the doctor who saves the
life of somebody to whom you’re devoted.
But don’t bother about that yet. At present
that’s in Dr Pryce’s hands and mine. You’ve
made an unlimited offer, and I think you were
right to make it&mdash;you’ve risked the skins of
every man in the club, and you ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
ready to risk your own skin to save them.
Probably it won’t come to that, but if it does
I’ll tell you. Meanwhile there’s another thing
to settle. Who’s to be secretary?”</p>

<p>“Mandelbaum says he would take it if a
small salary were attached. He has asked
me to propose that.”</p>

<p>“We can’t pay a salary and I wouldn’t take
Mandelbaum if he paid to come in. He must
find somebody else to propose that nonsense.
You can tell him I said so if you like. Mandelbaum
doesn’t happen to be one of the things
I’m afraid of just now. The fact is, Mast&mdash;and
you’re a good deal responsible for it&mdash;we
are getting too disorganised and demoralised
here. I don’t want to turn the place into a
Sunday-school, but I will have some decency
and order. And I want a strong committee,
because in consequence of this Lechworthy
incident it may be necessary for the whole
club to take action as the committee directs.
Pryce is all right, but you admit your own
weakness. You were elected, because you
had the gift of the gab, and you can make it
useful to us. I want you to propose Hanson.
Bassett was never a strong man, and that fat
German who flatters himself that he’s worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a salary is no better. Hanson is the man.
He’s steady and he knows things.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best for him,” said Mast. “I
must not canvass, of course.”</p>

<p>“It’s no good; it would work the other way.
But if you get a chance between now and
luncheon of getting your knife into Mandelbaum’s
election, don’t miss it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mast. He was glad that he
was to make a speech; it was a thing that he
did well.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget&mdash;you owe a debt to the
club, and you’ve told me that you’re ready to
pay when I call on you.”</p>

<p>Sir John was satisfied with this interview.
The Rev. Cyril Mast would be a second string
to Sir John’s bow. The second string was
not of the strongest, and probably would not
be wanted. But if, for example, some further
divergence occurred between the views of Sir
John and those of Dr Pryce, Sir John thought
he might find that second string useful.</p>

<p>The meeting that afternoon was brief and
without excitement. Mast proposed Hanson
in a short but admirable speech. Mast, with
the appearance of a dissipated boy, had on
public occasions the elegant and sonorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
delivery of a comfortable archdeacon. His
prepared speeches had point and a dry wit
that was quite absent from his ordinary conversation.
Mandelbaum withdrew, in a few
pathetic words that caused much amusement,
and Hanson was elected unanimously.</p>

<p>The new secretary was a quiet and reserved
man of middle age. Eight years before he
had been a prosperous Lancashire manufacturer.
Then for a week he had gone mad;
and as his madness did not happen to be of a
certifiable kind, he was now paying for it with
the rest of his life in exile. He was the best
chess-player in the club and perhaps the best
all-round shot; with the revolver Dr Soames
Pryce was in a class by himself. Hanson
spent four hours every day over chess. He
used work where the Rev. Cyril Mast used
whisky, and he had not let himself slip down
even in a climate where all occupations are a
burden. If you talked to him, he was pleasant
enough, and you found him rather exceptionally
well-informed; but you had to begin the
talking. He was melancholy by nature, but
he had realised it and did his best to keep his
melancholy to himself. The work of the
secretaryship was a godsend to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John had never before sought the society
of the Rev. Cyril Mast, but now he meant to
keep in touch with him. It was not only
because, if it should happen that there was a
violent and desperate thing to be done, he felt
that he could make Mast do it. Sir John appreciated
keenly the trappings of civilisation;
he wished things to be done decently and in
order. He could not make the Exiles’ Club
in Faloo quite like the London clubs of which
he had ceased <i>ipso facto</i> to be a member, but
he worked in that direction. He respected&mdash;almost
in excess of its merits&mdash;the Baringstoke
family, but when Lord Charles Baringstoke
entered the public rooms of the club in pyjamas
and a dressing-gown, Sir John resented it.
Public opinion in Faloo was not strong enough
to stop drunkenness, but there were limits,
and the limits had of late too frequently been
exceeded. There had been noise and brawling,
and worse. Mast had been a bad offender;
his conversation with some of the members
was one stream of witless and senseless filth,
and in his hours of intoxication he had been
beyond measure bestial and disgusting. Yet
it had been said that Mast had his moments,
and he had shown some ability, though with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
little judgment to direct it. Sir John began
to think that association might effect something,
for Mast like most weak men took his
colour largely from his company. He did not
dream of reforming Mast, for the man was
congenitally vicious; but he thought he
might effect a temporary break in the dreary
see-saw of swinishness and sentimentalism
that made up the man’s life, and this would
help to stop the growing disorder in the
club.</p>

<p>So he complimented Mast on his speech,
and Mast, like any spaniel, was delighted with
a little attention from the man who had
chastised him.</p>

<p>“I’ve something else I want you to do.
I’m sending a couple of servants to pack up
all Bassett’s effects. You might superintend
that&mdash;see that there’s no pilfering and that
everything is properly sealed up. And, by
the way, I’ve ordered a grilled chicken at nine
to-night, and reserved our last bottle of
Chambertin. I should be glad if you’d
join me. I daresay Pryce will come in
later.”</p>

<p>Mast accepted these proposals with alacrity.
He was conscious of some faint glow of self-respect&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of vanity, which so often serves
the same purpose.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Sir John received a
note from Dr Pryce, brought by a messenger.
It contained little more than a request that his
clothes might be sent him, and the statement
that he would write on the morrow if he could
find time.</p>

<p>Over the grilled chicken that night Sir John
was rather absent-minded. He did not seem
in the least inclined to say anything further
about Mast’s excellent speech, although he
had the opportunity.</p>

<p>“And when do you expect Dr Pryce?”
Mast asked.</p>

<p>“Not to-night after all. I’ve heard from
him, of course. The poor girl’s really ill.
But still we must hope for the best. Pryce has
wonderful skill and experience. Shall we&mdash;er&mdash;join
them in the card-room?”</p>

<p>In one corner of the card-room Hanson,
the new secretary, was giving Lord Charles
Baringstoke a game of chess. There was nobody
in the club whose play gave Hanson more
trouble. Hanson played like a scholar; his
opponent played like a demoniac with occasional
flashes of inspiration and was gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>ally,
but not invariably, beaten. To-night,
for instance, he looked up triumphantly from
the board.</p>

<p>“Well, old cockie?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hanson, “that is so. I’d
given you credit for something better, and
when you unmasked, my position was hopeless.
Serves me right. Quite interesting though.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what. My game’s improving?”</p>

<p>“No, Charles,” said Hanson, “it’s clever
but unprincipled, and always will be. Still,
it’s always suggestive. Now let me see if I
can’t wake up a little.”</p>

<p>“I say,” said Sir John bitterly from the
card-table where he was playing a difficult
hand, “is chess a game that requires so much
conversation?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Hanson.</p>

<p>“We’ve made papa quite cross,” said Lord
Charles Baringstoke as he arranged the pieces.
He was not allowed to win again that night.</p>

<p>Mast played very sober bridge with very bad
luck. He could not hold a card.</p>

<p>“I’m a perfect Jonah to-night,” he said
after his third rubber, as he paid his loss.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir John, genially, as he
gathered the money, “we shall have to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
you overboard. Come along now. We were
very late last night. Bed’s not a bad idea.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Cyril Mast followed him meekly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The King drove furiously, but Dr Pryce was
not a nervous man. When they arrived at the
King’s house, Lechworthy was pacing the
verandah anxiously, awaiting them. Dr Pryce
was presented to him, but very little was said,
for the doctor wished to see his patient at
once, and went off to her room.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour had passed before he reappeared
on the verandah.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor,” said Mr Lechworthy, eagerly.
“I have been much alarmed&mdash;needlessly, I
hope. What is the matter with my niece?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the name of it,” said Dr
Pryce. “I’ve seen it several times here&mdash;never
in Europe.”</p>

<p>“She is seriously ill?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. But Miss Auriol has a fine
constitution, and if we can fight through the
next thirty-six hours, recovery is likely to be
very rapid. Unfortunately, those two native
girls, with the best intentions, have been
playing about with native remedies.”</p>

<p>“And they are useless?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are very much worse than that.
However, it won’t happen again, and now that
I have talked to them, Tiva and Ioia may be
quite handy.” At the moment Tiva and Ioia
were frightened out of their lives, weeping
tears of bitterest penitence, and wishing they
were dead.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lechworthy, “you will be able
to use them as nurses.”</p>

<p>“A nurse who can’t take a temperature isn’t
much use to me at present. I shall be nurse
and doctor too. But they can do little things
under my direction&mdash;fetch and carry and so on&mdash;and
they’re willing enough.”</p>

<p>“I feel a terrible responsibility in having
brought Miss Auriol here. I had hoped,
doctor, that you would be able to give me
better news.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, that will come to-morrow.
Meanwhile, there are things I must see to. Is
Smith still here?”</p>

<p>For the moment Lechworthy did not understand
that it was of the King that Pryce spoke
in this unceremonious way. “The King?”
he said. “Yes, he wished to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’ll go and find him.” He
paused a moment. There was something in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the plucky, self-controlled wretchedness of the
old man that appealed to him. “There is no
immediate danger,” he said. “If there were,
I would tell you. I am going to remain here,
and in one point I want to prepare you. Miss
Auriol is ill now, but she will be worse this
evening. I expect a further rise in temperature,
and there may be delirium, and in consequence
some noise. But you must not let that
upset you too much&mdash;it’s foreseen and I shall
be ready to deal with it. If she gets a good
sleep afterwards, I shall be quite satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for telling me.
Indeed&mdash;I wish I could thank you better for
all you’re doing for us. It is good of you to
have come and to devote so much time to us.
I feel it&mdash;far more than I can express at
present.”</p>

<p>“My time here is of little value. You
understand then&mdash;I cannot say that Miss
Auriol is out of danger, but there’s room for
hope. I’ll do my best, Mr Lechworthy. Go
and see her for a few minutes now, if you like.
After that, I would rather she were left alone,
unless she asks specially for you and begins
worrying.”</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy was almost aggressively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cheerful during the few minutes that he spent
with his niece. Her room was pleasantly
cool, and so darkened that he could only just
make out the pale face and the mass of hair
on the pillow. Mr Lechworthy expressed the
opinion that Pryce seemed to be an able doctor
and would put her right in no time.</p>

<p>“And how do you get on with him, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Hilda, faintly, “that he is
the very gentlest man I ever met.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Mr Lechworthy. “You like
him then. That’s right.”</p>

<p>Hilda’s estimate of Dr Pryce would probably
have excited some mirth among his friends at
the Exiles’ Club. Lechworthy, as he resumed
his notes on South Sea Missions, found himself
puzzled by Dr Pryce. Somehow or other
Lechworthy had expected to see a furtive,
very polite, shaky little man, one who would
try to ingratiate himself&mdash;something like Mast
or Bassett. He found that he could not fit
Dr Pryce into any reasonable idea of the
fugitive from justice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pryce had found the King asleep
in a long chair in the garden. The King had
spent less than one hour in bed, and at such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
times he slept when he got the chance. But
he was awake and alert almost as soon as he
heard Pryce’s voice.</p>

<p>“And what is this illness?” he asked immediately.</p>

<p>“The same that you had&mdash;and your boss
man on the plantations.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the King. “Then you must
cure her.”</p>

<p>“You, like your plantation boss, are a man
and a native; Miss Auriol is a woman and a
European. I got on to your case at once;
here, before I arrived, Miss Auriol had been
made to swallow a mess of boiled leaves&mdash;of
a kind that might have poisoned a woman in
good health. She has the disease in a worse
form than you had it. I could give you horse-medicine;
I should kill Miss Auriol if I gave
the same doses to her. Well, I don’t expect
you to understand. But you can understand
this&mdash;on the whole, the probability is that Miss
Auriol will die.”</p>

<p>“You stop here?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“My servants, my house, myself&mdash;all are
at your disposal. I am no more King here:
here the doctor is King. All that you say will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
be done. But Miss Auriol must not die. I
have given my word that you can save her and
that you will save her.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a fool,” said Dr Pryce, bluntly.</p>

<p>“Why? I was ill&mdash;it was the same thing.
You saved me&mdash;so you save her too. She
must not die. It means too many things.
If she dies, other people will die. You will
die, Dr Pryce.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” said Pryce, smiling. He took
his revolver from the case at his belt, held it
by the barrel, and handed it to Smith. “Catch
hold of that, will you? Thanks. Now then,
you can either put a bullet through my head
or you can take your words back. You shall
do one or the other. Refuse and I leave you
to do the doctoring.”</p>

<p>The King examined the revolver, and handed
it back again.</p>

<p>“I apologise,” said the King. “But I have
not slept much, and so I judge badly. You
must excuse me. Perhaps I wished, too, to
make a test. You will take no notice. It
<span class="lock">is&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I’m in a hurry,” said Pryce. “I want
fresh milk for my patient. I’d like cow’s milk,
but that can’t be got. Goats?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the King. “I had yesterday
to decide the possession of a goat. It was a
goat in milk, valuable because the milk could
be sold to the Exiles’ Club. Shall I have some
milk sent up?”</p>

<p>“How far away is the goat?”</p>

<p>“About a mile.”</p>

<p>“Then have the goat driven here, and
driven very gently. I’d like to vet the beast
first. If she’s healthy, then with a little
modification the milk will do. Have you an
ice-machine here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I shall want a good deal of ice to-night
probably.”</p>

<p>“I will see to that. Is there anything else?”</p>

<p>“I may want some brandy later, and if so
I want the best I can get. You used to have
<span class="lock">some&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Of the genuine old cognac that the French
padre gave me. There is still one bottle left.
It is at my office. I will send a messenger for
it.”</p>

<p>“Right. See about the goat first, please.”
Dr Pryce turned back to the house.</p>

<p>There he found the tear-stained Tiva waiting
for him. In her hand she held a plant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
small yellowish-white flowers. Dr Pryce had
sent her to get it.</p>

<p>“See,” she said eagerly. “All right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right,” said Dr Pryce,
taking the plant. “You’re a good girl,
though a fool in some respects. You can go
back to Ioia now. And, remember, you do
not enter Miss Auriol’s room, unless she rings
that little bell by her bedside.”</p>

<p>In addition to doing much of the work that
usually falls to the nurse, Dr Pryce had also
to be his own manufacturing chemist. Two
cases of drugs and apparatus, that he had
brought with him, had been placed in a room
near Hilda’s. Dr Pryce unpacked what he
wanted. There was oxygen to be made and
stored, and the dangerous virtue of those
yellowish-white flowers to be extracted.</p>

<p>The King was kept very busy on the beach
that afternoon and evening. His schooner
had come in, and brought stores of all kinds,
some for the Exiles’ Club and some for the
King himself. There was a bag of letters,
and there was money for Lord Charles Baringstoke.
Two messengers had come down from
the palace by his direction, but they had
brought little news; the case was going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
much as had been expected&mdash;that was all Dr
Pryce would say. At ten o’clock, as no
messenger had come for the last four hours, the
King mounted his horse and rode up to the
palace.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve come, sir,” said Mr Lechworthy.
“Indeed, I was on the point of
sending for you.”</p>

<p>“Miss Auriol is better?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know. At sunset it was
terrible&mdash;one heard her moaning and screaming.
Dr Pryce had told me it would be so,
but still it was terrible. For the last two hours
he has been in her room and everything has
been quite quiet.”</p>

<p>“He dined with you, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No. He came in for a minute, and took
a cup of coffee. That was all. I can’t tell
you the things that that man has done to-day.
He has done everything&mdash;even to the preparing
of such food as she has been allowed to take.
If she recovers, it is to Dr Pryce, under Providence,
that she owes her life.”</p>

<p>“But why does he remain so long? Why
does he not come and tell us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I hope, of course, that she
is asleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“If she is asleep, then all is well, and he need
not remain.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Mr Lechworthy. “But
I have very great confidence in that doctor.
We had better not interfere.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes,” said the King.</p>

<p>“I heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“A door opened and shut softly.”</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce came out on to the
verandah where Lechworthy and the King
were seated. His coat and waistcoat were off.
With his left hand he rubbed his right forearm.
His smile was slightly triumphant.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got through all right, Mr
Lechworthy. Had a bit of a fight for it too.
Miss Auriol has been asleep for nearly two
hours and is still asleep.”</p>

<p>“Then why have you left us without news?”
asked the King.</p>

<p>“This another of your little tests?” sneered
Pryce.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to apologise again for
that? I will if you like. I was a fool, and I
know it now. I asked that only because I
did not understand. I did not think it would
annoy you.”</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy looked from one man to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
other. He did not understand to what they
referred.</p>

<p>“All right, old chap,” said Pryce. “I
couldn’t come before because Miss Auriol had
hold of my right hand when she went to sleep,
and I didn’t want to wake her again. Simple
enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she’s given you a cramp in your
right arm,” said Lechworthy.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t prevent me from holding a
knife and fork,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said the King. “We will
have supper together.” In another second
he would have clapped his hands.</p>

<p>“No noise,” said Pryce, quickly.</p>

<p>“Right. I will go and fetch servants myself.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy also rose and went through the
French windows. Dr Pryce stretched himself
at full length in a chair and closed his eyes.
He was rather more worn out than he would
have admitted.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again as Lechworthy
came back on to the verandah with a glass in
his hand. “I’ve ventured,” said Mr Lechworthy.
“Supper won’t be ready for a few
minutes. Whisky-and-soda, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Pryce, taking the glass.
“All the same, I don’t want you to run about
waiting on me.”</p>

<p>“But my dear doctor, I can’t even begin
<span class="lock">to&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Miss Auriol’s a prize patient,” interrupted
Dr Pryce. “Good constitution, good pluck,
good intelligence. By the <span class="lock">way&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>King Smith came out to tell them that
supper was ready.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Lord Charles Baringstoke
stretched himself in a lounge-chair
on the verandah. It was eleven in the morning,
and he had the tired meditative feeling
of one who has risen too early. The parrot,
who had been sitting for some minutes
motionless on its perch, swayed backwards
and forwards, considering its repertoire. It
produced a plausible imitation of the drawing
of a cork.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lord Charles Baringstoke,
wearily, “that’s rather what I think myself.”</p>

<p>Mr Mandelbaum waddled out to survey the
morning. Between his fingers he held a cigar,
slightly bloated and rather doubtful, and in
these respects curiously like its proprietor.</p>

<p>“Well, my young frient,” said Mandelbaum,
“I make myself a good breakfast zis
morning.”</p>

<p>“Gross feeder&mdash;what? I say, ain’t Soames
Pryce ever comin’ back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ask ze Herr Zecretary. I am noddings
here. Do you want pills?”</p>

<p>“No. You see, it’s rather a rum funny
thing. You know that lizard of mine&mdash;you
backed him once.”</p>

<p>“And lost my money. I hop’ he is dead,
zat lizart.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s dead all right, but that ain’t it.
I was exercisin’ him yesterday, when the boy
brought me a glass of sherry and angostura
with a fly in it.”</p>

<p>“Fly? Vot fly?”</p>

<p>“Just a plain fly, and I hadn’t ordered it.
But I fished it out and chucked it to my lizard,
who took it in one snap.”</p>

<p>“Vell, vell, vot about it? If you veesh
to gomplain zat your drink hat som’
<span class="lock">flies&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I did the complainin’ at the time, thanks.
I don’t let a thing of that kind go past me.
But what I mean is that the lizard started off
round the course like a flash of light. Cut the
record all to rags. Did two rounds and a bit,
and then he died, you know. But I’ve got
another lizard, and I can get another fly and
some more sherry. And I’ve got some money
just now, and Soames Pryce has got a lizard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that he thinks can’t be beaten. So that’s how
it is, you see.”</p>

<p>“I see, my young frient. Dope.”</p>

<p>“Well, puttin’ it coarsely, dope. And good.”</p>

<p>“Ve borrow a lizart and try him again,”
said Mr Mandelbaum, thoughtfully. “Perhaps
zat vos only a chance. Ach, here is Sir
John!”</p>

<p>The neatness and freshness of Sir John’s
attire made the other men look untidy. Sir
John had been distressed to hear of the carelessness
of one of the native waiters the day
before, but at the same time he thought it
would have been better if Lord Charles had
not thrown the glass in the boy’s face. Glassware
was so difficult to replace. It would
have been enough to have said a word to
Thomas about it. “And though the boy’s
eye will probably get all right again, we think
it’s politic not to handle the natives too
roughly.”</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry,” said Lord Charles. “This
club etiquette does hedge you around, don’t
it? And I give you my word of honour there
was nobody else there to chuck the blessed
glass at. And&mdash;oh! I say, when’s Pryce
comin’ back? He’s been away a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not quite a week. As it happens, I’m
expecting him every moment. But he goes
away again to-night.”</p>

<p>“But ze girl vos all right again now, zey
tell me,” said Mandelbaum.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said Sir John, genially. “A
good recovery, I’m glad to say. But possibly
Mr Lechworthy is still a little nervous. Smith,
too, can’t be there much, he has his business,
and I daresay he’s getting the doctor to help
him with his guests. Our friend Pryce knows
the island, you see.”</p>

<p>“Shall we gather at the river?” suggested
the parrot very loudly, and with distinct
lapses from accuracy in its reproduction of the
melody. Nobody took any notice of it.</p>

<p>“Well, if Pryce is comin’, I’ll wait,” said
Lord Charles. “I want to do a little lizard-racin’
with him.”</p>

<p>“Doubt if he’ll have time for it. You see,
Charles, I’m sorry to disturb your plans, but
we want a little business with the doctor.
Committee.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll find a canoe to take me over to
the <i>Snowflake</i>. Unsociable lot on that boat&mdash;never
come ashore for a drink or anythin’. I
should do ’em good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sorry to disappoint you again, but the
<i>Snowflake</i> left Faloo this morning.”</p>

<p>“Where to? When’s she comin’ back?”</p>

<p>Sir John stroked his beard and looked very
discreet. “I’m afraid,” he said, “I’m not
in a position to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am gettin’ it in the neck this
mornin’, I don’t think. Mayn’t do what I’ve
done&mdash;can’t do what I wanted&mdash;and not to be
told anythin’ about anythin’. Krikey! And
nothin’ for breakfast but two oranges and a
bad headache. What a life!”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” laughed Sir John. “You keep
it up too late, you and Mast!”</p>

<p>“<em>Shall</em> we,” screamed the parrot with much
emphasis on the first word, and then paused.
With its head on one side, it blinked at Sir
John and observed parenthetically, “You
damned thief!” For the moment it had forgotten
what it had first intended to say.
“Gather at the river?” it suddenly added
with perfunctory rapidity.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Sir John knew no more
than the others about the destination of the
<i>Snowflake</i>. Nor did he know when she would
return to take up her owner. His information
was derived from a very laconic note from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Dr Pryce, received on the previous evening.
“Syndicate chucked,” wrote Dr Soames
Pryce. “Lechworthy partners Smith. <i>Snowflake</i>
leaves to-morrow morning, but returns
for Lechworthy. Shall be at the club for a
few hours then. So please call committee to
meet me and explain.” That morning Sir
John had received the King’s formal notice of
his intention to buy out his partners. The
letter was brief, severely correct, business-like
in every phrase, and clearly had nothing of
King Smith about it except the signature.</p>

<p>The situation was very serious. No longer
had the Exiles’ Club the slightest hold over
King Smith. Nor did it seem likely that the
King’s association with Lechworthy would be
confined to the business venture. The King,
Sir John had guessed, had other schemes. A
desperate crisis must sometimes be dealt with
in a desperate way, and of the desperate ways
it is better to say as little as possible. If one
uses the knife to cut the knot and all comes
free, it may be more comfortable afterwards
to ignore what has happened and to hide the
knife. Sir John spoke of the departure of the
<i>Snowflake</i>, for this was, or would be in an hour,
pretty generally known, but he was not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to babble of the situation to irresponsible
people. He was careful to emphasise the note
of indulgent good-humour, and gave no indication
of the anxiety that tortured him.</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce came across the lawn with
irritating slowness, rolling a cigarette as he
walked. He greeted Sir John and the other
two men, and made one or two poignant observations
on the personal appearance of Lord
Charles. Then he turned to the parrot.</p>

<p>“Nice morning, Polly, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hell to you, sir!” said that profane fowl
promptly.</p>

<p>Sir John showed pardonable signs of impatience.
“Hanson and Mast have been
waiting in the secretary’s room for some time,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I’ll come.”</p>

<p>But in the hall a further interruption took
place. Thomas came forward.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir, but one of the native
boys has got his eye a good deal cut about.
Gentleman threw a glass at him yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now. Another time.”
said Sir John.</p>

<p>“No,” said Pryce, “I must go and have a
look at him. I shan’t be long, probably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Meanwhile, you and the others can get through
all the formal business&mdash;you don’t want me
for that. You’ve explained the situation?”</p>

<p>“I’ve spoken of it to Hanson and Mast, so
far as I know it. You ought to have written
in more detail. Do be as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry,” said Pryce, cheerfully,
as he followed Thomas.</p>

<p>The formal business went through, including
the provisional election of a new member, and
some desultory discussion followed. The Rev.
Cyril Mast looked ill, shaky and depressed.
He asked many questions, most of which could
not be answered, and repeated at intervals that
in his belief Dr Pryce would pull them through.
Sir John was barely civil to him, and glanced
repeatedly at his watch. Hanson was
taciturn.</p>

<p>Half an hour had elapsed before Dr Pryce
entered the room. He was quite conscious
that he was being talked about as he entered.
He nodded to Hanson and Mast, dropped into
a chair, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“At last!” said Sir John, severely.</p>

<p>“That chap won’t lose the sight of the eye,
but he’s had a damned near shave.”</p>

<p>Sir John controlled himself with difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
“Very interesting, doctor. We are not here,
however, to consider the fact that one of the
native servants has not lost his eyesight, but
a subject of almost equal importance&mdash;the
liberty and probably the lives of every white
man on the island. Dr Pryce, gentlemen,
comes fresh from the enemy’s camp. He was
called in, as you know, to attend Lechworthy’s
niece, and he has had unusual opportunities
for observation. He has already sent us, very
briefly, some alarming and serious news. We
shall be glad if he can supplement it in any
way, and if he will tell us to what conclusions
he has come.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear,” said Mast.</p>

<p>“The conclusion to which I have come,”
said Pryce, “is that Faloo is finished, so far as
we are concerned. The Exiles’ Club is done,
D-o-n-e, done. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauve qui peut</i>&mdash;that’s the
order.”</p>

<p>His three hearers looked at him, and at one
another. There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“Rather a sweeping conclusion,” said Sir
John, suavely. “I should have to feel very
sure that our case was desperate before I
accepted it. What has been happening up at
the King’s palace?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“The first few days I was a good deal occupied
with my patient, who is now practically
well again. Lechworthy and the King had
two or three consultations together, at which
I was not present. It was not till yesterday
morning that they came to their final agreement.
Then, as soon as Smith had gone,
Lechworthy asked if he could have some talk
with me. Well, he told me all that had been
arranged, quite fully and frankly.”</p>

<p>“And you believed him?” asked Mast,
with a silly assumption of acuteness.</p>

<p>Dr Soames Pryce took no notice of the
question and continued. “Lechworthy’s
business partnership with the King was first
touched upon. I did not know before what
terms the syndicate had made with the King,
and when I heard them I was not pleased.
It’s not surprising that, as soon as he got the
chance, Smith supplanted us.”</p>

<p>“You were one of the syndicate yourself,”
said Sir John.</p>

<p>“I was asked to put a couple of hundred
into the business when I came here. I paid
my footing. I knew, of course, that the syndicate
had Smith by the neck, and that this
was necessary. But I did not know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
were picking his pocket at the same time,
which was unnecessary. We needn’t discuss
it. Lechworthy will take our place. But
that is merely a temporary arrangement, for
if the King and Lechworthy succeed in doing
what they intend to do, there will be no more
trading. Under the trader lies the patriot.
The King’s scheme is that Faloo shall be the
asylum of a dying race. You were not far
wrong, Sweetling. It is to be Faloo for its
own people. No white man is to set foot on
the island. Civilisation is not to contaminate
it, for civilisation kills the native. Under
British protection, which is sought, this would
be possible.”</p>

<p>“Great Britain is to be asked to protect an
island, of which it is to be allowed to make
no use whatever,” said Sir John. “Come,
doctor, we are practical people.”</p>

<p>“Well, Smith is ready to pay for anything
that he has. He is willing, too, to have the
thing tried experimentally for a few years,
and to risk everything on the experiment
being successful in arresting the deterioration
and decay of the native race. Lechworthy,
too, is just the man to pull such a thing through.
He owns an influential paper, and he contri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>butes
largely to the party funds. He is not
often heard in the House, but he is working
behind the scenes most of the time. The
idea is sentimental, inexpensive and not
dangerous, for France isn’t going to worry
about Faloo.”</p>

<p>“The missionary question,” suggested
Hanson.</p>

<p>“That created a difficulty for some time.
Smith’s way out of it is disingenuous, but it
has worked. The white missionary is barred,
but native Protestant converts will be admitted
freely, and a church will be built.
Religion is accepted but not secular education.
There will be a church, but there will be no
school. As for the Catholics, Smith appears
to do what he likes. The priests will ask to be
transferred to another island&mdash;a sphere of
greater usefulness. They came here enthusiastic,
but they’ve grown slack and they’ve
done themselves too well. Smith knows
something perhaps, and could write a letter
if necessary, and they know that he could.
At any rate there are to be no more Catholics
in Faloo. That was a point which told tremendously
with Lechworthy. Of course, we
know that in a very short time there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
no more Protestants either. We know what
happens to the Protestant convert when the
white man is away and there is neither moral
support nor public opinion to back him.”</p>

<p>“If you had worked on that,” said Mast,
“you might have separated Smith and Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“It might have been tried,” said Sir John.</p>

<p>“It was, and it failed. You see, Sweetling,
Smith had been ready for it. The line taken
was that the true religion must prevail,
whether by the native convert or by the white
missionary. The idea of the first Protestant
church in Faloo had a glamour about it for
Lechworthy. A site is chosen already for that
church, and a rough plan sketched out. And
I have not the least doubt that it will actually
be built. Smith knows what he’s about. I
found I had come up against real faith, and
with that one cannot argue. And even if I
had succeeded, what was the use? So soon
as the business partnership comes into being,
we lose our hold on Smith, and the position
becomes intolerable. He can charge us anything
he likes for the goods he supplies. He
can refuse to supply us altogether. He can
refuse to carry our mail. And certainly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
would no longer risk his popularity by standing
between us and those of the natives, who,
with good reason, hate us. The game’s up.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rien ne va plus.</i>”</p>

<p>“The position is certainly very grave,”
said Sir John. “What about the <i>Snowflake</i>?”</p>

<p>“Was to have left yesterday afternoon.
Lechworthy asked me if I had any letters to
send, but I had none. The delay was caused
because Smith had not had time to finish some
papers that Lechworthy wanted to send on.
Lechworthy himself sent, amongst others,
letters to his editor and to his political chief.
They will catch a steamer at the nearest port
on the route. Then the <i>Snowflake</i> returns to
Faloo, to take up Lechworthy and his niece.
Those letters are on their way now, and you
can imagine the kind of letters that the
astonished visitor to Faloo is likely to write.
This island has become too public for us.”</p>

<p>“If those letters arrive, that must be
so,” said Sir John. “Well, I deprecate any
interference with private letters, of course,
but there are exceptional cases. Here are we,
a body of men, who, from mistakes and misunderstandings,
are anxious to retire from the
world. Without our invitation and against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
our wishes this vulgar wealthy manufacturer
intrudes himself here, and proposes to make
the place intolerable for us. We had a right
to see that those letters were not sent. It
seems to me, Dr Pryce, that you might have
gone on board the <i>Snowflake</i> and, one way or
another, managed that.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re wrong, Sweetling. If I could
have done it, it would have meant only a
temporary postponement of our troubles, but
it was not possible. I went to the King’s
house as a suspected man. Smith, in a
flurried moment, let me see that he suspected
me&mdash;he thought I meant to kill Miss Auriol,
or at any rate to allow her to die. Lechworthy
did not suspect me at all; if I had wished to
join the <i>Snowflake</i> for this preliminary trip he
would have arranged it; he is really absurdly
grateful to me. But even he would have
thought my desertion of the patient queer,
for he wishes her to be still under a doctor’s
care. Smith would have gone further, and
would have sent a message to the skipper. Do
you think a suspected man is going to have
a chance to fool with the mail that’s entrusted
to a sober Scotch skipper?” Here he looked
steadily at Sir John. “Why, he’d have as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
good a chance of scuttling the ship, and he’d
have no chance of that. Suspected people
don’t have chances.”</p>

<p>“This is most disappointing,” said Mast,
peevishly. “I had felt confident that Dr
Pryce would pull us through. And what has
he done? Nothing.”</p>

<p>“And what would you have done, you silly
boozer?”</p>

<p>“Order,” said Sir John. “These provocative
<span class="lock">expressions&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Very well. Let’s hear what the Rev.
Cyril Mast would have done.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, I should have to think over
that,” said Mast.</p>

<p>“If you’d learned to think a little earlier,
you would not have brought Lechworthy to
the Exiles’ Club. You made this trouble, you
know.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” said Sir John. “I’ve told
you so myself, Mast.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deny it. And I tell you once more
that there is no possible act of reparation which
I am not ready to make.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say anything about that,” said
Pryce. “Not at any rate within the present
limitations as to language at committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
meetings. And I don’t think there’s much else
to say. I’ve one more little thing to tell you,
and I heard it as I was on my way here. A
native, whom I was treating for pneumonia just
about the time of Smith’s rejection as a member
here, recovered. To-day he came running
after my gee in a highly agitated condition.
He had something to say to me. Briefly it
came to this, that the white men on the island
were to be killed as he put it, pretty dam
quick. If necessary, Smith was to be killed
too. This was all decided, and I understood
that he was one of the conspirators who had
decided it. But, as he was pleased to say
I had saved his life and he wished to save mine,
I was to clear out on the trading schooner, I
believe. Personally, if there’s any conspiracy
on foot, I think the conspirators are likely to
get hurt. You were right about those piano-cases,
Sweetling. Smith has got seventy-five
men up at his house, and they all have rifles.
I mention it in case you may think it of any
importance. My own opinion was not altered
by it. Lechworthy is not doing any detective
or police-work. He’s not sending over a list
of names or anything of that kind. But I
make no doubt that he has said something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of the nature of the Exiles’ Club. If we stay,
we are lost. If we disperse, there’s still one
more chance. With many of us the scent is
cold and the hounds have given up. And the
world’s wide. I propose, Mr President, that
the question of winding up the club, or of any
alternative scheme be considered at another
meeting to-morrow. I have not much more
time now. And you do not want to decide
hurriedly.”</p>

<p>Sir John rather dejectedly agreed, and there
was no dissentient voice.</p>

<p>“Then shall we meet again at this time
to-morrow?” asked Mast. “That would suit
me.”</p>

<p>“What do you think, doctor?” asked Sir
John.</p>

<p>“Meet then if you like. I shan’t be here.
I’m going fishing with Lechworthy. You
know my views. The members of the Exiles’
Club should disperse deviously, and as soon
as Smith’s rotten schooners can take them.
As to the winding-up of the club, I’m content
to leave it in your hands, Sweetling.”</p>

<p>“So in a crisis like this you find it amusing
to go fishing,” said the Rev. Cyril Mast with
offensive bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fishing is an occupation,” said Pryce.
“Pitching idiots through windows is another
occupation and it’s difficult to keep off it
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Order, please,” said Sir John. “These
suggestions of violence are most improper.
At the same time you, Mr Mast, are the very
last person who should venture to offer any
criticism. Now, gentlemen, as to the date of
the next meeting. What do you think, Mr
Hanson?”</p>

<p>“This day week,” said Hanson. “By that
time we may know more&mdash;or other things may
have happened.”</p>

<p>“I can be here then,” said Pryce.</p>

<p>The date was agreed upon, and Pryce came
out into the hall. He was going to walk back
to the King’s house, and he thought he would
take a drink first. In the hall Lord Charles
Baringstoke came up to him with Herr
Mandelbaum in attendance.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say,” said Lord Charles. “I’ve
got my money now, you know. And I’ve
got a lizard I’d like to back against yours&mdash;or
against the clock if you like.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pryce, “can’t a man have a
drink first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Funny thing&mdash;just what I was goin’ to
propose. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Sherry and Angostura,” said Dr Soames
Pryce, impressively. “And I’ll have two
flies in mine.”</p>

<p>Mandelbaum’s deep bass laughter rolled
upwards from a widely-opened mouth.</p>

<p>“Golly!” exclaimed Lord Charles. His
look betokened no shame but considerable
curiosity. “You’re on it, of course; but, I
say, how did you know?”</p>

<p>“When you smashed a glass on the face of
that native boy you nearly cut his eye out&mdash;but
you didn’t cut his tongue out.”</p>

<p>“Goot! Ver’ goot!” roared Mandelbaum.</p>

<p>“So you’ve been patchin’ his face up?”
said Lord Charles. “I see. Well, it’s my
mistake, ain’t it? But you’ll have a drink
all the same.”</p>

<p>“The cheek of it! What, you dirty dog,
you try to swindle me and then expect me to
drink with you? Well, well, one mustn’t be
too particular in Faloo, and you were born
without any moral sense, Charles, and it may
be Lord knows the last drink we’ll take
together. But you’ll drink with me this time.
Come on, Mandelbaum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Mandelbaum quoted a German couplet to the
effect that a drink in the morning has a
medicinal value. Lord Charles protested, but
permitted Dr Pryce to pay. Sir John and
Hanson joined the party. Mast had gone off
by himself. He was sick of the alternate
patronage and reprobation of Sir John. He
was sick of his own miserable position&mdash;to be
despised by the members of the Exiles’ Club
was to be despised indeed. His weak imaginative
vanity pictured himself saving the
situation, winning even from his enemies a
frank and generous admiration. But his
drink-bemused brains supplied no plan of
action. He found an unfrequented corner of
the garden in which to sulk and swill.</p>

<p>Pryce remained but a few minutes, promised
Sir John that he would write if there were
anything worth writing, and went on his way.
And then Sir John called Hanson apart.</p>

<p>“You said very little at the meeting, Hanson.
The modesty of the newly-elected, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hanson. “I had something to
say, but it was not the time.”</p>

<p>“Too many listeners? Pryce?”</p>

<p>“I formed an idea about him&mdash;you also,
probably.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“He had meant to do&mdash;er&mdash;something that
was not discussed. But he managed to give
me good reason why he couldn’t do it. I can’t
blame him. And I fear he’s right in his conclusions.
What was your idea?”</p>

<p>“That Dr Soames Pryce does not care one
damn what becomes of the Exiles’ Club&mdash;or
what happens to himself either.”</p>

<p>“He’s a very unemotional man, hates
scenes, prides himself (so I should imagine) on
his philosophical calm.”</p>

<p>“He has himself well in hand, but it struck
me that it was done with great difficulty. He
would have much liked to kill our friend Mast.
Unemotional? Why, the man’s being burned
alive with his emotions!”</p>

<p>“What emotions?”</p>

<p>“Not anger with Mast, nor sorrow, nor
fear. There’s one white girl on the island&mdash;isn’t
that explanation enough?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it. It may be that
you’re right. But that doesn’t affect the main
thing&mdash;we have got to quit Faloo.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you that it doesn’t affect that.
But still&mdash;do you play chess, Sir John?”</p>

<p>“Rarely, but I’m not your class, and I
shouldn’t care for a game at the moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had not meant to suggest it. And when
you play what is the object of your attack?”</p>

<p>“The King, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“It is the same here&mdash;in Faloo&mdash;now. It
is too simple to amount to a problem. We
can win in one move.”</p>

<p>“I must hear this.”</p>

<p>“In the garden, I think. It’s not talk to be
overheard.”</p>

<p>The two men went down the steps of the
verandah together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>Sir John took a cigar from a golden and
armorial case and snipped the end.</p>

<p>“Well, Hanson,” he said, “you’re a new
man on the committee, and new men bring
new ideas. So we are to attack the King, are
we? It can be done, of course. You may
leave the details to me, but if I saw the regrettable
necessity, you may take it from me
that Smith would be removed to-night. But
what I do not see is how it would do us any
good. Smith still stands between some of
these angry natives and ourselves, though it’s
a question how much longer he will do it. If
the King goes, there is still Lechworthy.
Then the <i>Snowflake</i> is coming back here. So,
you <span class="lock">see&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Hanson. “But that is
not the way the game should be played.
Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. That is what I want.” Sir
John lit his cigar, and was careful not to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the match down on the lawn, for he disliked
untidiness.</p>

<p>“Our first move is to make a feint of accepting
the situation. At the next meeting we
go through the formalities of winding up the
club; we discuss quite openly the means of
getting away from the island, and speculate as
to what will be the safest place to which to
retreat. We allow Smith to hear all this, and
from him, or from Pryce, it will go through to
Lechworthy. Nobody but you and I, Sir
John, will know it is a feint. We shall be
doing nothing that will surprise Pryce, since
he thinks it is the only thing left for us; and
he had better not be told. I know the man is
loyal, but I mean to cut out even the possibility
of a mistake. The other side will continue
the game according to their original plan.
Lechworthy and his niece will sail away in the
<i>Snowflake</i>, and take the next available steamer
for England. Our second move is then&mdash;and
not till then&mdash;to arrange for the disappearance
of Smith. And that wins us the game.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Smith, as is common enough in these
islands, has no child; neither has he any
official and acknowledged wife, which is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
less common. The succession would certainly
be disputed. The support and the weapons of
the white men would turn the scale in that
dispute. In other words, the new King of
Faloo would be our nominee, and would have
to carry out the conditions on which he gained
our support. He would repudiate Smith’s
scheme entirely; he would refuse any business
or political association with Lechworthy.
What can Lechworthy do? Nothing. I
doubt if he could have got Great Britain to
give this weird sort of protection to Faloo,
when the King and people of Faloo asked for
it and would pay for it. He is too practical
a visionary to attempt it when Faloo repudiates
anything of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ve worked it out. Smith’s a good
life, and I’d never thought about the succession
myself&mdash;you’re sure of your facts there?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Good. We must do it. But it’s no cinch.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Hanson. “You heard
what that native boy told Dr Pryce. A
rising against the white men may take place
any moment now, and might upset my scheme;
we should have to deal with it as it came and
wait chances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think that’s all gas. I used to believe
in it, but it would have come earlier if it had
been coming at all. I never met a native yet,
except Smith&mdash;and he has got a dash of white
man in him&mdash;who had the grit to start a thing
of that kind and run it through. I’d something
quite different in my mind. When
Lechworthy hears from the new King he will
know perfectly well that we are at the bottom
of it.”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“Then he will give us all away.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. He would find it too difficult
to explain why he had not given us away
before. Besides, he is not a vindictive man;
his conscience is his only guide, and if his
conscience does not prescribe a man-hunt now
it will not prescribe it then. I know something
of Lechworthy. He would cut his hand off&mdash;and
do it cheerfully&mdash;to convert us, so that
we gave ourselves up to what is called justice;
but to pursue and to punish is not in his nature.
Besides, his gratitude to Pryce will hold him.”</p>

<p>“You may be right. It is difficult to forecast
so far ahead, and things we have not even
imagined may happen, but you may be right.
If it comes off the position is better than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
We’ve dealt with Smith with moderate success,
but there are not two Smiths and we shall do
as we like with the next king. You’ve shown
us the best game to play and we will play it.
Then, for the present, we do nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Hanson. “When the
next meeting of committee is called we
acquiesce in Dr Pryce’s proposals. We take
first steps towards winding-up. They will
be merely paper-work, and serve to fill in time
till Lechworthy goes. Then&mdash;I leave it to you.
You must be prompt. Smith must go.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir John. “I think it is likely
that his death will be the result of a private
quarrel. That will be the accepted version.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You’ll arrange all that.
Lunch, eh?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Sir John. And they
turned back towards the club-house.</p>

<p>It occurred to Lord Charles Baringstoke to
be curious as to the affairs of the club that
afternoon. His method was direct. “And
what did the committee do?” he asked Sir
John, as they sat on the verandah together.</p>

<p>Sir John neither hesitated nor lied. He
told the exact truth so far as he knew it&mdash;as
to one transaction which had taken place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
committee, while they were still waiting for
Dr Pryce.</p>

<p>“We’ve given provisional election to a Mr
Pentwin, whose credentials and application
arrived by last mail. He himself arrives on
Smith’s second schooner. He should be here
in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“I got a newspaper by the same mail. He
was Pentwin’s Popular Bank, and the police
believe he’s in Barcelona. He’s got the stuff
with him too.”</p>

<p>“We need not go into that, Charles,” said Sir
John, with dignity. “We do not discuss the
mistakes that members here may have made
in their past life, nor the mistakes which the
police may have made. Mr Pentwin sends his
subscription and a letter of recommendation
from the widow of an old member, Herbert
Wyse.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t know him.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sir John. “Poor Wyse was
called to his rest before you arrived here.”</p>

<p>Wyse had thought that he wished to get
away from the police. After a few months on
Faloo he had found that what he really wanted
to get away from was himself and the thing he
had to think about. He cut his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The provisional election of Pentwin had
been a matter of course. The only comment
in committee had been a remark of Hanson’s
that he would sooner have had a recommendation
from a living member of the club. As
Sir John said, if Pentwin was not suitable, he
would not remain a member; one or two such
cases had occurred before and had given no
trouble.</p>

<p>As to the principal business of the committee,
Sir John said not one word to Lord Charles
Baringstoke, who believed that this provisional
election of Pentwin had been the principal
business and was quite satisfied. Sir John, as
has already been said, had told the truth about
the election so far as he knew it. He was
exact in saying that a subscription and letter
of recommendation from poor Mrs Wyse had
been received, and that the name given was
Pentwin. Also, the solitary passenger who
was at present cursing the cockroaches and
discomforts of Smith’s smaller trading vessel,
and enduring many things in order to reach
Faloo, called himself Pentwin and was thus
addressed by people who had time to talk to
him. The initials H. P. were on his rather
scanty luggage, and the Christian name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
hero, or villain, of Pentwin’s Popular Bank
was undeniably Hector.</p>

<p>But this man was not Hector Pentwin,
knew very little about him, and knew less
about bank business than he did about some
other things. Hector himself, flying from
justice with a presentiment (subsequently
fulfilled) that he would be caught and punished,
would have been much surprised had he known
that anybody was impersonating him. He
could have imagined no possible motive. Yet
the impersonator (whom we may continue to
call by the assumed name of Pentwin) had his
sound and sufficient reasons.</p>

<p>He was a round-faced little man with a cheery
smile and an inexhaustible flow of rather
commonplace talk. He had money to spend,
and appeared immune to alcohol and anxious
to prove it. In two days he seemed quite to
have fallen into the ways of the club, and was
on the best of terms with all the members.</p>

<p>“Pentwin will do very well,” said the
president, and the secretary agreed.</p>

<p>The Rev. Cyril Mast extended patronage to
Pentwin, who received it with a seemly
gratitude.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Mast, “as a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the committee I have to exercise discretion.
I can’t discuss the committee’s business.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Pentwin. “I
shouldn’t expect it. Besides, I’m the least
curious of men.”</p>

<p>“Apart from that, I shall be only too glad
to put you up to things.”</p>

<p>“That’s really kind of you. I’m a new
member, but I hope to spend many happy years
here, and for that reason I don’t want to begin
by treading on the toes of other members.
You understand what I mean. Nobody has
said a word to me about Pentwin’s Popular
Bank, and I appreciate that. It shows nice
feeling. Before I make any blunder, you can
perhaps tell me what subjects to avoid with
particular members.”</p>

<p>They chatted over the subject, and Mast
became from force of habit rather vinously
and aggressively moral on the sins of other
people. He noticed it himself and half
apologised for it.</p>

<p>“You see, Pentwin, I have never been able
to shut my eyes to the serious side of life.
Have another drink?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will,” said Pentwin, and did.</p>

<p>All went smoothly and peacefully now at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Exiles’ Club. A tentative order to King
Smith had been received and executed with
alacrity, and so far he had shown no disposition
to quarrel with the men whose partnership he
was renouncing. Members of the club who
had had fears of what Lechworthy might do
had been quieted by Sir John, or Hanson, or
Mast. It had all been arranged, they were
told. Pryce, clever fellow, had got Lechworthy’s
promise of silence in exchange for his
professional services to Lechworthy’s niece.
Mast had the feeling of elation which comes
to a man who after a period of depression finds
himself becoming of importance. Sir John,
after his talk with the chess-player in the
garden, had talked very seriously to Mast.
“We have a new scheme on foot,” he said.
“Pryce is not in it, and you are.” Nothing
could have made Mast better pleased. True,
he was not told what the scheme was. Until
Lechworthy’s departure nothing was to be
done except the first formal step towards the
winding up of the club; and it was generally
to be given out that Pryce had squared Lechworthy.
“Once Lechworthy has gone,” said
Sir John, “you’ll be called upon to act.
You’ll be shown what to do. Do it, and you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
wipe out your past follies, and the new scheme
will go through and we shall all be safe.”</p>

<p>Sir John had considered that whoever killed
King Smith would be very lucky indeed if he
escaped being killed in his turn. Mast had
made the trouble, and had professed his readiness
to redeem his mistake. Mast could be
spared, for he had greatly deteriorated since
his election to the committee. He might as
well die that way as from drink. Hanson had
planned the game; Sir John would play it;
Mast would be merely a miserable pawn,
gladly sacrificed for the great end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wretched cat’s-paw felt himself
the man of destiny. On some subjects
he might chatter freely, but he preserved an
iron discretion where Sir John enjoined it.
To any member who pressed a question he
was reassuring but gave no details. “We’ve
gagged Lechworthy all right” was a favourite
phrase with him. “You can sleep in your beds.”</p>

<p>He did not mention Lechworthy to the new
member, for so far he had no reason to be
proud of the subject. But what Mr Pentwin
did not hear from the Rev. Cyril Mast he heard
at length from Lord Charles Baringstoke, who
had no more discretion than the club parrot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lechworthy&mdash;you must have heard of
him,” said Lord Charles. “Portmanteaux
and piety, you know. He’s a G.T. at present,
with a pretty niece with him. Funny his
bargin’ in here, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“And where did you say he was living?”</p>

<p>Lord Charles closed one eye impressively.
“No use, young man. The same idea had
occurred to me, but there isn’t a girl in an
English high-class boarding-school who’s quite
so well looked after as Lechworthy’s Hilda.
She’s up at the King’s house, and you are not
invited to inspect the goods.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Tell you what happened to myself. I
thought I’d have a look, just to see if anything
could be done. I never said a word to a soul
but I went off on my own. The garden of the
place is surrounded by a scraggy hedge standing
on the top of a high bank, and it occurred
to me that there was a chance the girl might be
walking or sitting out in the garden. So I
climbed up the bank and looked through the
hedge. I didn’t see the girl, but I did see
four natives with rifles. Smith has got a
young army of them up there, and they are
picked smart men. I never thought I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
be seen, but I suppose I moved the bushes or
something. As their rifles went up to their
shoulders I dropped and rolled down the
bank. If I’d not done that I should have
been jewelled in four holes, like Sweetling’s
presentation watch that he’s so proud of.
You leave it alone, my son. It’s not healthy.”</p>

<p>“You never tried sending in a native with
a note for the girl?” suggested Pentwin.</p>

<p>“It’s like this. There’s a pack of servants
there, and there are the gents with rifles.
But to every other native the place is taboo.
There’s not enough tobacco and coloured
shirts in the world to bribe a native to try to
get in. You might get a boy to go as far as the
entrance and holloa. The guard would turn up,
and he could hand over his letter. But the
chances are that the letter would go straight
to the King, or to Uncle Lechworthy, or to the
doctor&mdash;who’s a bit of a boss there just now.”</p>

<p>“What doctor’s that?”</p>

<p>“Soames Pryce. On the committee here,
and a pretty tough proposition too. The
girl fell ill&mdash;very ill&mdash;rotten. Pryce pulled
her through and is stopping on. He’s got
Lechworthy in his pocket to do what he likes
with, they tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Pentwin. “Well, things being
so, I shan’t bother about the girl.”</p>

<p>To do Pentwin justice he had never in the
least bothered about the girl. He knew that
he would need shortly to communicate with
a person in the King’s house, and he wished
to know how to do it, but that person would
not be Hilda Auriol. He now permitted himself
to be initiated by Lord Charles Baringstoke
into the mysteries of lizard-racing, and
took his losses with equanimity. He won
them back, and more too, at bridge that evening,
and had the honour of being congratulated
on his game by the great Sir John Sweetling
himself.</p>

<p>“A very pleasant, cheery little fellow,” said
Sir John when Pentwin had gone up to bed.
“Self-made man, I should say. Not much
education or manners to boast of. But he’s
unpretentious and good-hearted, and his
bridge is really excellent.” Nobody values
unpretentiousness more highly than the incurably
pretentious.</p>

<p>Pentwin occupied the room which had been
Bassett’s. He had heard the story of Bassett,
but he was not a nervous man. Alone in his
own room, his air of careless cheerfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
vanished. He looked quite serious, but not in
the least depressed. He had the air of a man
playing a difficult game, but a man who had
played difficult games before and with success.</p>

<p>From his breast-pocket he took a small
canvas envelope, which contained all the
papers that he had brought with him, including
a wad of Bank of England notes and a
proof of his real identity. From the envelope
he took a sheet of memoranda, and added to
them with a sharp-pointed, indelible pencil in a
microscopic writing. He wrote slowly, though
he was familiar with the cipher which he was
using, and replaced the paper in the envelope.</p>

<p>In pyjamas and slippers he paced up and
down the room. Through the open window
he could see high up in the distance a tangle
of lights among dark trees, where the King’s
house stood.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said to himself, as he had often
said before, “one must see how things work
out.” He placed under his pillow the canvas
envelope, a revolver, and a leather bag containing
twenty-eight sovereigns and some odd silver.
Then he put out his lamp and got into bed.</p>

<p>He could hear a faint murmur of voices
below. Then steps came up the stairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the voices became audible. The two men
were standing at the top of the stairs now.</p>

<p>“You’ve no reason to be nervous,” said a
querulous voice, which Pentwin recognised as
Mast’s. “You can depend on me, Sir John.”</p>

<p>“But can I?” said a deeper voice. “It
will be at the risk of your life.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you tell me plainly here, and
now what it is? Why wait? I’ve shown
discretion?”</p>

<p>“Of late? Yes. But don’t talk so loudly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care one straw about the risk of
my life. When the time comes for me to
make good my word I shall do it. I’m only
too glad that you’ve given me the chance.
It amuses Dr Pryce to treat me as a fool and a
baby. He’ll see. Well, that doesn’t matter,
I don’t want to talk about myself.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. Don’t talk&mdash;it’s what you do
which counts. Now you’ve got to be patient.
You can’t eat your dinner till it’s cooked.
<span class="lock">You&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>The voices died away down the passage.
Pentwin heard a shutting of doors. All was
still. “Now,” thought Pentwin, “I wonder
what game is on there.” But it troubled him
very little, and in a few minutes he was asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>Lechworthy’s project for a pamphlet
dealing with mission work in the South
Seas had never been of a very ambitious
character. It was to be nothing more than
the notes of a passing traveller, with no intention
of comprehensiveness or finality, designed
only to awaken more interest in the missions.
Very rarely did Lechworthy lay aside any work
that he had projected and actually begun; persistence
and self-reliance had been the distinguishing
notes of his commercial career. But
now he gathered together the memoranda that
he had already made, wrapped them in a big
envelope, endorsed it and sealed it.</p>

<p>“Hilda,” he said, “you remember an idea
I had of writing something about the missionary
work, you know&mdash;I’ve given that up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hilda, who understood him
well, “I suppose so. There’s a good deal else,
isn’t there?”</p>

<p>Lechworthy’s mind had always been far
less constricted than his opponents had sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>posed,
and he was beginning now to adjust
himself to the new ideas and facts that had
lately come within his experience. Some
change of view had been dawning upon him
before he ever reached Faloo. His belief in
Christianity as expounded by the evangelical
section of the Church of England remained
unshaken, the main pillar of his life as it had
ever been. He still felt the encouragement
of missionary enterprise to be part of his
religious duty. But he had seen things, and
he had lost faith in some of the faithful.</p>

<p>He had found quite good men making
hypocrites and calling them native converts,
and had regretted that the wisdom of the
serpent is so seldom joined to the harmlessness
of the dove. He had found that the teaching
of Christianity had involved too often the
teaching of much which was worthless in
European civilisation and positively dangerous
when transported to these islands. With
many illustrations the King had made that
clear to him. He had found, too, that much
good work was being done by men whom he
regarded as lost heretics and spoke of as
“Romans.” To write the truth as he had
found it might do harm. And here, in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
remote island, out of the political and commercial
atmosphere that had sometimes distorted
his vision, and far from the petty wars of
sects, specious misrepresentation refused to be
called by any prettier name. Hilda herself would
not have shrunk from it with more acute disgust.</p>

<p>Accustomed as he was to regard all that
happened to him as specially ordained by
Providence, he meekly submitted to the change
in his plans which it seemed to him that Providence
had directed. The work which he had
designed had been taken out of his hands; it
might be that some vainglorious thoughts had
mingled with that design. And other work
had been given him. He regarded it as no
blind chance which had brought him to Faloo,
had saved him from Bassett’s revolver and
Hilda from the island fever, and had put him
into the hands of this strange native king,
with his scheme for making of his own little
island a refuge for some remnant of his race
against the devastating inroad of an unsuitable
civilisation.</p>

<p>In his new work Lechworthy was yoked with
an unbeliever, or at least with one who doubted.
The King made no profession of Christianity.
With the fundamental facts of Christianity he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was already acquainted, and for a philosophical
discussion of them he was always ready. He
professed a general toleration and a readiness
to be convinced by events. But he left Lechworthy
with no more than a conviction of his
honesty and a hope for his future.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the King, one evening, “we
are very good and mild people here, and we
wish to please. On some islands they fight
very often, and they eat man. But my
people are gentle, unless they are greatly hurt,
and so also am I. You, too, I specially wish
to please, and a little lie is easy and costs
nothing. But suppose you find me out, what
then? Would you be pleased?”</p>

<p>“I should not, sir,” said Lechworthy. “I
should resent it. In fact, it would make it
impossible for us to work together.”</p>

<p>“All right. Very good. That is what I
thought. So I do not say I think just the
same as you and repeat pieces of your sacred
books. It would be pleasant but untrue. So
when I say something else that may please you,
then you can believe me. You go to get me
British protection, to shut out the white men,
to leave Faloo for its own people. But you
want Protestant religion. I say that shall be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
In return I give this Protestant religion a very
good chance. I bring in the best native converts
I find, and they shall teach the religion.
Not boots, and square-face, and English
weights and measures, but just the religion.
And I build a fine church all correct. If I do not
do all I have said, then I am a liar and you may
take the British protection away from us again.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy smiled patiently. “You will
keep talking as if I carried British protection
in my pocket. I hope that something can be
done, and I shall do my best. But how often
have I told you that it is all very doubtful and
may end in nothing?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the King, stolidly, “you are a
political man, just the same as Gladstone. So
you understand how this can be managed.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not at all the same as Gladstone,”
said Lechworthy. “I have not the gifts, nor the
position, nor the influence that he had. <span class="lock">I&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“But still you will do it. You have a
newspaper, much money, many friends. I
think you too modest. If you wish you will
do it. If you do it I will give your Protestant
religion a very good chance.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t the chance be better,” said
Lechworthy, “if you allowed one white mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>sionary.
I could select the man myself&mdash;a man
who would be in sympathy with your views.”</p>

<p>“It is not then a religion for all races?”
asked the King. “Without the help of the
white man it cannot work&mdash;eh?” These
were calculated questions.</p>

<p>Gradually he brought Lechworthy to agree
with him. In the face of the doubter Lechworthy
felt that he himself must show no
doubt. In uplifted moments he did really feel
enthusiastic and confident.</p>

<p>Lechworthy went on in a steady and business-like
way, preparing his appeal for a
native Faloo, and requiring from the King
endless information. Were the people sober?
They were. As a matter of fact they had no
chance of drinking. Were they industrious?
Here the King hesitated a little. The people
of his race were naturally less active than
Europeans. But they could be made to work&mdash;oh,
yes. What were the statistics as to the
prevalence of crime and violence? There were
no statistics, but the King could give a general
assurance. Above all, was the Government
strong and stable, able to control the inhabitants,
and properly representative of their
interests?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I myself am the Government,” said
Smith, slightly aggrieved. “And what does it
matter?”</p>

<p>“I must show that your people are quiet
and orderly, and that they can with safety and
humanity be left to themselves; that no interference,
even in the guise of help, from the
more civilised nations is required here. It is
part of the foundation of the whole thing&mdash;the
essential foundation.”</p>

<p>And Lechworthy went on collecting such
facts and concrete instances as he could,
showing an appetite for names and figures that
dismayed the King. None the less, the King
was quite docile and did his best. Either by
the extent of his knowledge, or by the extent
of his ignorance, he was always astounding
Lechworthy.</p>

<p>The Exiles’ Club also astounded&mdash;and possibly
illuminated&mdash;Lechworthy. He got on well,
amazingly well, with Dr Pryce, whom he could
not help liking and admiring, and to whom he
was very deeply and sincerely grateful, but Pryce
was very reticent as to his fellow-members. It
was the King who was Lechworthy’s principal
source of information, and the King had many
strange stories to tell of the Exiles’ Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Lechworthy had not often been brought
into contact with bad men and criminals, and
his idea of the bad man was crude to the point
of childishness. He would have admitted
that we were all sinners, and that even the best
of men have their trivial defects and lapses,
but he had always thought of criminals as men
bad all through, bad in every thought and act.
He had never realised the share in humanity
that even the worst men sometimes hold.</p>

<p>It did not surprise him that there were occasional
scenes of disorder and excess at the
Exiles’ Club, but it did surprise him to find that
as a rule all was orderly and well-organised,
and that, without policeman or magistrate,
they obeyed the laws that they had been forced
to make. It did surprise him to hear that the
Rev. Cyril Mast, when he first came to the
island, instituted a Sunday morning service,
and that several members of the club, Sir John
Sweetling among them, attended it regularly.
It was Mast himself who, under an acute and
slightly maudlin sense of his own unworthiness,
had discontinued these services.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Smith, simply, “this Mast lives
badly, talks badly, drinks very much. But he
is a religious man and most unhappy about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
If he had a choice I think he would sooner be
quite good.”</p>

<p>“Every man has the choice,” said Lechworthy,
firmly; but to himself he admitted that
every man has not the same kind of choice.</p>

<p>The King was perfectly fair, too, in speaking
of the trouble between the exiles and the
natives. It was due to one special cause, and
it was a cause which drove the natives mad;
it made them forget all benefits that they had
received, and include both the innocent and
the guilty in one condemnation.</p>

<p>“The innocent?” said Lechworthy.</p>

<p>“Yes, innocent so far as the natives are
concerned. The native servants at the club
are treated well as a rule, well fed and well
paid, and they get many presents. Some of
the members have handled them roughly at
times, through drink or anger, but that is
uncommon, and Sir John does not like it. If
any of them is sick then Pryce comes and
makes him well again, just as he is making
your niece well again, and never anything to
pay. The native who has something good&mdash;fish
or fruit or fresh milk, can sell it better to
the white man than to another native. It is a
few of the younger men at the club who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
greatly wronged my people, but there are many
of my people who would like to destroy them
all.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could tell me more of this Dr
Pryce. Apart from all he has done for us I like
him. I can’t understand your ideas about him.”</p>

<p>“What ideas?”</p>

<p>“When Hilda was ill you said&mdash;truly, I
think&mdash;that Dr Pryce could save her. But
you said it would be necessary to frighten him.
Did you frighten him? Why was it necessary?”</p>

<p>“I thought he might like to kill her&mdash;you
too. But I did not frighten him, and I believe
I was wrong.”</p>

<p>“And that story of yours about the <i>Snowflake</i>?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. He asked me to get him
a passage on the <i>Snowflake</i>. I wondered&mdash;and
then I warned you. I said the ship and all
aboard her would be lost. I think I was
right then, and that it would not be so now.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I think you were wrong. He
knows that I would give him that passage, that
I’d give him the boat, that I’d give him anything.
He has asked for nothing.”</p>

<p>“That is because, when your niece was ill,
I made a little mistake, and he saw that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
suspected him. If he is suspected then his
plan is no good. He would know that.”</p>

<p>“It’s not an easy thing to find a good man
who’ll sacrifice his life for his friends. Why
should Dr Pryce do it for the scum at the
Exiles’ Club?”</p>

<p>Smith shook his head. “I do not understand
him,” he said. “He is the one man there that I
do not see through. He is straight&mdash;yes, but
then he has plenty. He does not take much
care of his own skin. I myself have seen him
risk his life&mdash;just for a game, for the sport.
Why not then also for the sake of the men with
whom he has lived for so long?”</p>

<p>“But you think he means us no harm now?”</p>

<p>The King waved his hand, as though to put
the suggestion aside. “I leave him here alone
with you. He takes you out&mdash;you and your
niece&mdash;shows you the island. Very well.
Every day he has a hundred chances, if he
meant harm. If I did not know that he meant
no harm he would have no chance at all. You
are the guest of the King of Faloo, and that is
an important thing with me. Besides, on
your safety all my plan depends.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think that way about him
now. You certainly would not be able to con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>vince
me of the opposite. Why did he ever
come to Faloo?”</p>

<p>The King shrugged his shoulders. “I did
once ask him that question. I have not asked
it of many of the exiles. The man they call
Charles will chat and laugh about anything,
past or present. Bassett once, when he had
drunk a little cognac, told me about himself.
Mast has made confessions when he was drunk,
and said they were all lies when he was sober
again. But most of them will not speak of the
past, and questions make them very angry.
However, I was very sick, and Pryce looked
after me. Perhaps he saved my life&mdash;who
knows? So I thought he would make me his
friend, and one night when he had sat late with
me I did ask him.”</p>

<p>“And what did he say?”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘Go to the devil!’ and put the
little thermometer-machine in my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lechworthy, “I’ve half a
mind to ask him myself.”</p>

<p>“If you take my advice, then no. If he
wishes to tell you, he will tell you. If he does
not wish it will be no good to ask.”</p>

<p>The general tendency of Lechworthy’s mind
was optimistic. His perplexities did not lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
him to depression. With a complete confidence
in an omnipotent power of good,
cognisant of and concerned in the smallest
details of even the least of the human swarm,
pessimism is impossible. Side by side with
“I do not understand” comes the consolatory
“I do not need to understand.” It is probable
that a patient submission to the limitation of
knowledge, at those very points where the
thirst to know is most acute, is one of the conditions
of happiness. It is rare among the
thoughtful men of the day.</p>

<p>His nature being simple and without vanity,
the ludicrous had no terrors for him. When,
for example, Tiva and Ioia made for him a
garland of flowers, he wore it with as little
concern as he would have worn a hat, and met
the cheerful chaff of Hilda or the doctor quite
unperturbed. He took a paternal interest in
Tiva and Ioia, but after one trial relinquished
any attempt to instruct them in Christianity.
Their readiness to make any declaration which
they thought was wanted, without the slightest
regard to its basis in fact, baffled him, and their
unintentional irreverence appalled him. He
had to admit that his knowledge of the native
mind was insufficient for his purpose. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
found himself at times regarding these pleasant,
brown, graceful, unthinking creatures rather
as some new kind of pet animal than as human
beings; and, finding himself in this attitude,
repented of it. He and Hilda learned from
them a native game, a sort of “knuckle-bones.”
It is doubtful whether Tiva or Ioia cheated the
more shamelessly at it; when detected, they
laughed cheerfully. In return he taught them
to avoid a frequent use of the word “damn”
as a simple intensive, and answered so far as
he could their many questions about Queen
Victoria and the British method of executing
murderers. He was equally ready to instruct
them about tube railways and telephones.
But when he spoke of such things they became
very polite but asked no questions; they did
not believe a word he said on those subjects
and were not interested.</p>

<p>It was a time of relief after danger&mdash;danger
to his own life and to Hilda’s. And of any
further danger that threatened Lechworthy
knew little or nothing. But the patrol at the
King’s house got plenty of shooting-practice
under the direction of the King himself; and
the King wore the air of a man who was
watching and listening, always listening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Lechworthy, instructed by Dr Soames
Pryce, caught fishes with names like
music and colours like the rainbow. Also,
instructed by Dr Soames Pryce, he mastered
the management of his simple snap-shot
camera and learned developing and printing.
Every day he was busy with King Smith in
working out the details of the scheme for
a native Faloo and preparing draft statements
to advocate it in England. “My holiday!”
he exclaimed to Hilda. “Why, I’ve never
had so much to do in my life. And I like it.”</p>

<p>Hilda, on the other hand, did very little.
She had been since her illness quieter and
gentler. She was listless and at times a little
melancholy. She let her management of her
uncle slip through her fingers, and even ceased
to manage herself; she was ready for anything
that Tiva or Ioia suggested, unless, of course,
it happened to be something that she thought
Dr Pryce would not like. Her uncle, vaguely
conscious of the change in her, said that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was still a little weakened by her illness.
Hilda put it all down to the enervating climate.
Tiva and Ioia, who had their own ideas, produced
for her a new music&mdash;songs in the
native tongue that spoke also in the universal
tongue. They sang one moonlit night on the
verandah outside Hilda’s room, when she had
just gone to bed. It was the music of ecstasy
and surrender. Hilda, in her night-gown,
stepped bare-footed across the room and
pushed the plaited blind aside. “Tell me
what the words of that mean,” said Hilda.</p>

<p>Tiva hesitated. She threw her head back
and her dark poetical eyes looked up to the
golden moon. “He mean,” she said in a voice
that was like a caress, “he mean ‘I love you
pretty dam much.’”</p>

<p>“You darlings!” said Hilda. “Sing it all
through once more, please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” she called when the
music stopped, and gave one long sigh. These
island nights, she thought, were beyond words,
too beautiful, overpowering.</p>

<p>On the following morning Mr Lechworthy
desired to speak with Dr Pryce, and the two
men walked in the garden together.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” said Lechworthy, “I’ve said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
very little so far about all you’ve done for us.
You haven’t let me,” he added plaintively.</p>

<p>“You see, Lechworthy,” said Pryce, “you
do exaggerate the thing so. If a bricklayer
who had nothing to do came and laid a few
bricks for you, you wouldn’t think it anything
to make a fuss about&mdash;especially if he did it
because he liked it. If an unemployed doctor
does a little doctoring for you, and enjoys
doing it, that’s the same thing. It’s what he’s
there for. Really, Hilda’s case gave me some
new and valuable experience, and I’m very
glad to have had it.”</p>

<p>The transition from Miss Auriol to Hilda had
come at one point of Hilda’s illness; it had
come by natural evolution from the circumstances.
Afterwards, when Pryce resumed the
“Miss Auriol,” Hilda wanted to know if he
was angry with her about anything, and the
“Miss Auriol” was then definitely abandoned.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lechworthy, “that’s your way
of looking at it. But you must see my way
of looking at it too. Now I don’t want to
think about the financial side.”</p>

<p>“There is none and can be none.”</p>

<p>“So you have decided, and I’ve submitted
to it. But I tell you this&mdash;if any doctor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
London had done as much for me, my conscience
would not have let me sleep until I had paid
him a very big fee indeed; and even then I
should have felt indebted to him every day of
my life. If I can pass over that financial side
it’s because even in the very few days that I
have known you I have come to regard you as
a friend. I do not make friends easily. In
questions of politics, and even, I fear, in
questions of faith, we are as far apart as the
poles. But I&mdash;I’ve formed a very high
opinion of you, doctor, and I want your
friendship.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pryce, “you force my hand.
I thought it would come to it. Before you
say anything further, Lechworthy, there is
something you ought to be told. Sit down
here, won’t you? At one time, to save the
men of the Exiles’ Club, I was ready and eager
to murder you and many others.”</p>

<p>“You meant,” said Lechworthy, “to sink
the <i>Snowflake</i>?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy did not look shocked, nor even
surprised. “Well,” he said, “the King
warned me not to give you a passage. We
speak in confidence, you and I; you will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
let him know that I told you this and will not
show any resentment.”</p>

<p>Pryce smiled. “Of course not.”</p>

<p>“Now at first, doctor, I said to myself that
you must be a very wicked man. I was
horrified. And then&mdash;I thank God for it&mdash;I
heard the voice of conscience. That voice
said, ‘Before you judge others, look at yourself,
Lechworthy.’ Now I’m going to tell you.
Some years ago a candidate for Parliament,
a man not of my colour, asked permission to
address the men at my works in their dinner-hour.
I ought to have refused him altogether,
or to have seen to it that he had a fair hearing.
I could have done either, and either would
have been right. I did what was wrong. I
said that if he addressed them it must be at
his own risk, well knowing that he would take
the risk. And then I dropped a hint here and
a hint there that if intruders said that they
would chance rough handling they could
hardly grumble if they got it. That was
enough. The candidate turned up and was
fool enough to bring his wife with him. Stones
were thrown, and the woman was seriously
injured; it was a chance that she was not
killed. There’s a well-known saying, doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui facit per alium facit per se</i>.’ It’s true too.
If that woman had died it would have been I&mdash;and
not the man who threw the stone&mdash;who
would have been in the sight of God her
murderer. Some of my men went to prison
over that affair; when they came out I did
what I could to make up to them for it&mdash;because
they had been punished for my fault.
That incident did me harm in my business and
in my political career, and that I could stand;
but it also gave the enemy their opening, and
injured the good cause that I was trying to
help. It’s terribly easy to be misled by one’s
political passions; when one is doing evil that
good may come one forgets that one is doing
evil. That was one of the things I had to
keep in my mind when Smith gave me that
warning about you. But there were others.
You won’t mind if I put it plainly.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Pryce, rolling a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“I thought about the Exiles’ Club. Here
are these poor chaps, I thought to myself, who
have found a corner of the world to hide in.
They no longer constitute a danger to Society.
They ask nothing but to be left alone&mdash;to be
hunted no longer. Can it be wondered at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they thought my coming meant the loss of
their liberty or their lives? I am no hunter of
men, but they didn’t know that. And if they
thought that, can it be wondered at that they
were ready to take any step, however desperately
wicked, to get rid of the informer and
save themselves? Ah! and I thought something
else, doctor, and it turned out to be right too.”</p>

<p>“And what was that?”</p>

<p>“I thought to myself, the man who is to
sink the <i>Snowflake</i> must face an almost absolute
certainty of his own death. He must sacrifice
himself&mdash;body and soul&mdash;to help the others.
If ever I see him I shall see the finest man on
the island.”</p>

<p>Pryce laughed. “This is becoming grotesque,
Lechworthy. If you can understand
the line I took, and can forgive it because you
understand it, that’s far more than I have
any right to expect, and I’m grateful. But
for goodness sake don’t try to put me upon a
pedestal. It&mdash;it won’t wash, you know.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me a bit, Pryce. Hilda fell ill.
The King told me you were the only man here
who could save her&mdash;otherwise she would die.
But he pointed out that it gave you a chance&mdash;that
there would be a great risk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was nonsense. Smith’s a barbarian
and doesn’t understand things. I came to you
as a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you came, and I saw you and
talked to you. I’ve come across many men
in my life, doctor, and I make up my mind
about them quickly now. If Hilda had died
I should still have been quite sure that you
had done your very best for her, and would
have seen to it that the King took the same
view. But you saved her. Now I’ll tell you
something else; if Hilda had not fallen ill, and
we had disregarded the King’s warning and
taken you aboard the <i>Snowflake</i>&mdash;well, I don’t
know what you would have done.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know myself,” said Pryce.</p>

<p>“But I do know that Hilda and I would
have been safe. You would not have carried
out your intentions.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not.”</p>

<p>“And for telling me of those intentions,
which you were not bound to do, I respect you
the more. You may have meant to be my
enemy, but you have been indeed my friend.
And that brings me to what I wanted to say.
You’ve done more for me than I can say.
Now then, what will you let me do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
you? Out of friendship tell me. I set no
limit.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good man, Lechworthy,” said
Pryce, “and you set no limit. But though
I’m not a good man, I do. I accept your
friendship gladly and I’m proud to have it,
but we’d better let the rest go.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lechworthy, “I had an idea,
but it’s rather difficult to tell about it because
I don’t want to put impertinent questions to
you. You might fairly tell me that your
private history is no concern of mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pryce, “up at the club it is
not etiquette to speak about what happened
before we came here. The chaps there have
never shown any curiosity as to my story, and
they have never been told it. I think I know
what they imagine&mdash;something quite unspeakable
and having, as it happens, no basis in
fact. It has never mattered to me. They
don’t care, and I don’t. And what was your
idea?”</p>

<p>“I want to take you back to England with
us. I believe in you, and I can’t bear to see
you wasting your life here. I don’t know
what you’ve done, but I can’t believe it is
anything which can’t be cleared up and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
right. Anything that my influence and persistent
exertions could do for you would be
done. Now, is there any reason against it?”</p>

<p>“As I said before, you’re a good man,
Lechworthy. But, unfortunately, there is
every reason against it. It would be quite
impossible. Look here, I’ll tell you the story.
There was a woman who had been married for
ten years. They had been for her ten years
of hell&mdash;a peculiar and special hell that you
know nothing about. And then her husband
fell ill, and I attended him. He was rather
loathsome, but I did what I could for him and
he began to recover. One day I was called to
the house and was told that he was dead; I
went up, satisfied myself as to the cause of
death, and said nothing. I never told the
woman that I knew what she had done, let her
believe that I was deceived, and gave a certificate
that the man had died from his illness.
You see, she was a good woman by nature, but
had been driven near to madness by ten years
of&mdash;well, only a doctor could appreciate it.
I was a very young man, and I was heartily
sorry for her; her husband was better dead
anyway. Three months later this woman,
being a woman, broke down and confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
everything. Exhumation and discovery
followed&mdash;arsenic was a stupid thing to have
used. There was my ruin ready-made.”</p>

<p>“So you came to Faloo?”</p>

<p>“Not then. It was not fear, but disgust,
that drove me to Faloo. I settled my little
account with the law. They gave me a year
in the second division, and it was considered
that I had been let off lightly. When I came
out, I found of course that I had been turned
out of my profession. Two stories were
confidently believed about me, and both were
false. The first was that I had conspired with
the woman to kill the man&mdash;that had been
distinctly disproved, but it made no difference.
The second was equally false but less easy to
disprove. It was the corollary that the
knowing young-man-of-the-world always puts
to such a case&mdash;that the woman had been my
mistress. The only reason why I was not
turned out of my clubs was because I had
forestalled them by resigning. Some old
friends cut me, but I had expected that. The
old friends who did not cut me were more
difficult to bear&mdash;I could not stand the duffer
who failed to hide that he was proudly conscious
of being merciful. I happened to hear from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
one of these men that a desk-waiter at one of
my old clubs had cut and run with a deal of
the club’s money. I remembered that waiter,
and in many ways he wasn’t a bad chap&mdash;he’s
our head-waiter at the Exiles’ Club to-day.
I hunted out his wife, thinking she might need
some help. I saw her through a bad illness
and gave her money, and she was grateful.
She told me about Faloo, and I decided that
moment to come here. The good people
wouldn’t have me, so I thought I’d try the
wicked. I’ve been here ever since&mdash;and, by
God, I’ve suffered less from the sins of Faloo
than I did from the virtues of my own country.
It’s over now. The exiles must leave this
place, of course, and they know it. They
are probably making their plans now. The
only plan I’ve got is never to set foot in
England again&mdash;never, never!”</p>

<p>It was in vain that Lechworthy argued.
He did not pretend to condone what the doctor
had done. But he pointed out that after all
it was done under circumstances which would
arouse some sympathy. The punishment,
apart from the legal punishment, had been
slanderous, vindictive and shameful; it might,
if it were put before the public in the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
light, produce a strong reaction in the doctor’s
favour. He might be reinstated in his profession.</p>

<p>“Lechworthy,” said Pryce, with rather
grim good-humour, “when I was a little boy I
did not like to have my head patted. And
nowadays I don’t think I should like to be
defended and excused; it doesn’t seem to me
to be the treatment for a grown-up man.”</p>

<p>“You’re too proud, doctor,” said Lechworthy.
“Think of my position. If I’d
never come here you could have gone on undisturbed.
I must go on with the King’s
great scheme. I’ve put my hand to the
plough and I can’t look back. The saving
of a race is a grand thing, and I feel called to
do my utmost to help. It’s work almost comparable
to the work of Wilberforce, whose
name I bear. But if it succeeds, then I drive
you from the island which you have made your
refuge, and scatter the men whom you have
made your friends.”</p>

<p>“You may make your mind easy, Lechworthy.
I’ve thought the thing over at
length now, and I don’t take quite the view
that I did at first. There are too many people
in England to-day who know of Faloo, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>fore,
sooner or later, the police would get to
know of it. Faloo may be an independent
nation having no extradition or other treaties,
but in practice that would not amount to a row
of beans. You do these poor devils who have
been my companions for the last few years no
disservice; if you put them on the run again,
you at anyrate give them a good start. You
do me no disservice either, for I’ve grown
pretty restless of late and pretty sick of things.
I shall be glad to start wandering again.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s one thing you must let me do.
When Hilda and I reach Tahiti we must part
from the <i>Snowflake</i>. We’ve got fond of her,
and we don’t want to sell her. We’d sooner
a friend had her. You can well afford to
keep her. I shall send her back to Faloo,
doctor, and in future she will be yours. You
will start your wanderings in her.”</p>

<p>Pryce reflected a moment. “Very well,”
he said. “I shall sail in the boat I meant to
sink, but I don’t know that it matters. Thank
you very much, Lechworthy. I shall be glad
to take the <i>Snowflake</i> and to let you be disproportionately
generous to me.”</p>

<p>They shook hands on it.</p>

<p>The meeting of the committee of the Exiles’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Club had been fixed for the following day, but
Pryce decided after all not to be present at it.
He wrote a short note to Sweetling telling him
that he would agree with any arrangements
made for winding up the club, and that there
was no further news. He added that a general
meeting would of course be called and all the
members informed.</p>

<p>That night, as on several previous nights,
the King and Lechworthy went to their work
directly after dinner, and Hilda and Pryce
were left alone together. The air seemed hot
and heavy, the smoke from the doctor’s
cigarette hung in lifeless coils.</p>

<p>“Hilda,” said the doctor, “it ought to be
pleasant down by the pool to-night. Shall we
go there?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hilda. “I should like that.”</p>

<p>The sky was powdered with stars. The
falling water made an unending melody, and
here by the pool the air seemed cooler and
fresher.</p>

<p>Hilda, lying at full length on the mat that
had been spread for her, spoke drowsily.</p>

<p>“To-night,” she said, “nothing that happened
before is real or matters a bit. I’ve
always been here, lying by the pool and listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>ing
to the water&mdash;here at the world’s end, out
of all the trouble. Is there really a place called
London?”</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s going on there just now?”
said Pryce. “Dawn perhaps. Did you often
see the dawn in London, Hilda?”</p>

<p>“Yes, driving back from dances, with the
violin music still swinging in my head, tired
out and feeling as if I should never sleep again.
The dawn seems cruel somehow then. But
you know.”</p>

<p>“It’s long since I was there, but I remember
a dawn down by the river. Spots of light
were dotted across it where the bridges come.
Then the sky turned pale, without a touch of
colour, and the lights on the bridges went out.
A mass of black in the Embankment gardens
began to sort itself out into shrubs and plants.
About twenty minutes later you could see
the blue of the gardener’s lobelias. I hate
lobelias.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed Hilda. “So do I.”</p>

<p>“It was an anæmic, civilised dawn, different
to the rush of glory we get here. And the
tattered derelicts that one met, trying to
snatch sleep on the seats, or wandering about
and cursing God for having made them another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
day. That was before I had ever heard of
Faloo, but I remember thinking even then that
there ought to be a place somewhere for the chaps
who have gone under&mdash;a refuge for the people
for whom civilisation has been too much.”</p>

<p>“I want you to know,” said Hilda, “that
I’ve heard your story. My uncle told me. I
made him.”</p>

<p>“My very disreputable story,” said Pryce,
grimly. “Well, it’s better not to sail under
false colours, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Her hand stole out and pressed his arm
gently. “You must come back to England
with us,” she said, speaking quickly. “It’s
too horrible that you should have been
wronged like this&mdash;punished and tortured and
maligned for an act of mercy. That’s a thing
that must be put right. These blind fools
must be made to see. Oh, when I think about
it, there are people that I could kill.”</p>

<p>“You’re splendid, Hilda. But it can’t be.
One must take the world as one finds it. If
doctors who gave false death-certificates were
not severely punished, that would open the
door&mdash;‘open the door’ is the recognised
phrase, I think&mdash;to all manner of crime. You
see it has to be. And though you might make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
a few kind people forgive what I did wrongly,
you could never make the world forgive me
for having been in prison. I should never get
back to where I was. But it doesn’t matter
much, you know. Somewhere in these
islands I shall find my place. And if I’m
ever inclined to feel sore about it I can always
remember that I’ve met you, and what you
thought and said, bless you!”</p>

<p>“You won’t come back to England?”</p>

<p>“Can’t, Hilda.”</p>

<p>She sat up now. She plucked a leaf, and
pressed its cool surface to her warm lips, and
flung it aside. Then she looked steadily into
his eyes and spoke deliberately.</p>

<p>“Then I too ... am not going back.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying, Hilda?”</p>

<p>Her eyes closed. “Don’t you know? I
know, though you have never told me&mdash;said no
word of it. I know that you love me just as
surely as I love you, dear. I know, too, why
you have not told. It’s because you saved my
life, and because you think that if we went
back to England and you married me you
would ruin it.”</p>

<p>“I should not have let you know; I’ve
not played the game,” said Pryce. “True?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Why, it’s the only truth in my life. I love
you, Hilda. I worship you. I adore you. I
know now that I could never have let you go
without telling you. But I know, too, that I
am not even worthy to speak to you&mdash;to kiss
the hem of your garment.”</p>

<p>“Come to me,” she murmured almost inaudibly,
and swayed towards him.</p>

<p>They lay side by side now, his arms about
her, his lips on hers. For a while neither
spoke.</p>

<p>“Three more days,” he said at last. “Three
more days in Paradise, dearest.”</p>

<p>“Not only three more days, but all our
lives,” she whispered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>“Hanson,” said Sir John Sweetling,
“you are leaving to me all arrangements
for the removal of Smith.”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Hanson. “In fact, I would
sooner know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the time’s getting very near.”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“In connection with the&mdash;er&mdash;removal of
Smith, I should like to take Mast fully into our
confidence. We have the committee this morning,
and Pryce won’t be there. I’ve heard from
him. It is my belief that you are right, and
that Pryce cares for nothing but Hilda Auriol,
and won’t come here again. You and Mast
and myself will make a solid triumvirate.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Hanson. “I don’t think
there’ll be any harm in it.”</p>

<p>So Sir John Sweetling unfolded this scheme
to Mast, and outlined the horrible part which
Mast himself would be expected to play in it.
But he put the best appearance on it, as he did
upon everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Smith is a traitor,” said Sir John, sternly.
“He owes everything to us. Before we came,
he owned practically nothing but unsaleable
land. Now he is established as a trader, and
is doing really well. Suddenly he throws us
over. Why? Simply because he thinks that
with Lechworthy as a partner he will be able
to screw a little more money out of it for himself.
He betrays us all to Lechworthy, and I
consider even now that disaster may come of
it. For that crime&mdash;there is no other word for
it&mdash;the punishment is death, and it will be
for you to administer the punishment. It’s
rough-and-ready justice perhaps, but it is
justice. When a coloured native race and a
white race live together on an island, the
natives must be made to take their proper
position; the penalty for treachery must be
sharp and sudden if it is to act as a deterrent.
I’m speaking of principles which are tried and
sound&mdash;principles that have helped to build
up the Empire. Hanson is fully with me.
The lesson must be given, if only as a salutary
warning to the other natives.”</p>

<p>“I’m to do this?” asked Mast, staring
stupidly. “That was what you meant&mdash;that
I was to kill Smith?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Precisely. The work of a public executioner
is unpleasant work, though of course no
moral responsibility attaches to it. The responsibility
rests with Hanson and myself,
who discussed the man’s case and decided what
was to be done with him. Of course if you
find yourself too shaky and nervous, we must
get another man for the work. But you’ve
made a good many protestations, Mast. Precisely
because it is unpleasant work, you ought
to accept it and to be glad of a chance of repairing
the injury you have done to the members
of this club.”</p>

<p>“I shall do it,” said Mast, doggedly. “But
I don’t see how it repairs anything. I don’t
see how it helps us at all.”</p>

<p>It was only then that Sir John spoke of the
certainty that a disputed succession would follow
upon the death of Smith, and of the use
that the exiles would be able to make of it.
It was so much better to represent Smith’s
death as a punishment for a past crime than
as a murder for a future advantage.</p>

<p>Mast remained spiritless and rather sullen.
He was a little stunned at finding what was
required of him. He had liked Smith&mdash;had
been rather intimate with him at one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s no other way?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sir John became a little impatient. “That’s
all been talked out. Look here, Mast, if your
promises were so much hot air, and you’re too
frightened to do what you said you would, own
up at once and waste no more of our time.”</p>

<p>Mast scowled. “On the day that Lechworthy
leaves Faloo the King will die,” he said.
“I shall kill him. Does that satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to think it over. I needn’t
wait for this damned committee meeting,
need I?”</p>

<p>“Of course you must wait. Pryce is away,
and we must have three for the look of the
thing. It won’t take twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>At the meeting Sir John read out Soames
Pryce’s brief letter. “Well, now,” he said,
“what do you think, Hanson?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be done,” said Hanson,
stolidly. “Read and noted, that’s all. In
Pryce’s absence we needn’t go through a farce
of winding-up. We can’t call a general meeting
of the members yet, because we can’t yet
put before them the alternative scheme (of
which Pryce knows nothing) to which the
majority of the committee are agreed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is so,” said Sir John. Mast nodded
assent.</p>

<p>There was a meeting of three other men on
the island that morning. The King and Lechworthy
had walked out together just beyond
the garden of the King’s house, when a little
man came running along the road towards them.
The King recognised him at once as the new
member of the Exiles’ Club. Pentwin had
been presented to the King on landing. Now
members of the Exiles’ Club knew that they
were not wanted in the neighbourhood of the
King’s house; moreover, the King reflected
that one of these men had already attempted
Lechworthy’s life. The King was suspicious.</p>

<p>Pentwin took off his hat and bowed profoundly
to the King. Might he be permitted?
He wished to speak privately with
Mr Lechworthy. He had business of importance
with him.</p>

<p>“I think you haven’t,” said the King,
bluntly. Lechworthy looked from one to the
other with mild surprise.</p>

<p>The little man was not in the least offended.
“Oh, but I can prove that to Mr Lechworthy’s
satisfaction,” he said smiling, and dived one
hand into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>In a flash the King’s revolver was out, and
covering him. “No, you don’t,” said the
King.</p>

<p>Pentwin stepped back a pace. “It’s all
right, sir,” he said apologetically, “it’s only
papers.”</p>

<p>He drew an envelope from his pocket and
handed it to Lechworthy. Smith toyed pensively
with his revolver.</p>

<p>From the envelope Lechworthy drew a
visiting-card printed in blue. It bore the name
of Mr Henry Parget. On the left-hand corner
was printed “Criminal Investigation Department,
Scotland Yard.” The envelope contained
two other papers, and Lechworthy
glanced quickly through them.</p>

<p>“Quite correct apparently,” he said. “I
don’t think, sir, there is anything to fear.
This gentleman really has business with me,
and I shall be glad to talk it over with him.”</p>

<p>“You may assure yourself that I carry no
weapons of any kind,” added the man from
Scotland Yard who had passed as Pentwin.</p>

<p>The King did assure himself thoroughly&mdash;he
had searched men before. “You must
understand,” he said, “why I am so careful,
Mr Pentwin. My friend, Mr Lechworthy, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
already been shot at by one of the white men
here; the man who did it is dead.”</p>

<p>“Quite natural that you should be careful,
sir,” said Parget, smiling. “And now may I
get on to my business?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You will take him up to the
house, Mr Lechworthy? That’s right. And
send one of the boys with him when he goes,
will you? You see, Mr Pentwin, a stranger
wandering alone there would be shot at once;
I am careful for you as well as for Mr Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>The King strode off down the road with a
rapid and yet graceful gait.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Mr Parget,” said Lechworthy,
“keep close to me and you’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>They turned and entered the garden.</p>

<p>“Grand place this, sir,” said Parget, looking
round him. “I’ve seen nothing like it in my
life before. The King of this island seems a
pretty active man&mdash;bit suspicious too.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind that, Mr Parget.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” said Mr Parget, “I’d sooner be
suspected wrongly than rightly any day. I
suppose, sir, you have very little difficulty in
guessing why I am here.”</p>

<p>“None,” said Mr Lechworthy, “but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
wondering a little how it was that Scotland
Yard came to send you.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, to tell the truth, it was a bit of
luck. You may have heard of Pentwin’s
Popular Bank.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen his advertisements; we’ve always
refused them in my paper.”</p>

<p>“And quite right too; the thing was obvious.
Well, this chap Pentwin seems to have realised
that he’d come to the end of it, and he made
his preparations for leaving. But he had to
skip before the preparations were quite finished;
in fact our men were into his house only twenty
minutes after he’d left. A batch of letters
came for Pentwin, and we took the liberty of
opening and reading them. One was from a
Mrs Wyse, widow of a man whom we wanted
and never got. It seems he came out here and
committed suicide here. Well, Mrs Wyse
was a friend of Pentwin’s&mdash;a friend and perhaps
a bit more. That letter was full of references
to the Exiles’ Club, mentioned Sweetling’s
name, told Pentwin how to make his
application and send his subscription, and gave
him his route to the island. There was another
letter of introduction enclosed. If those
letters had come one post earlier, there’s not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
a doubt that Pentwin would have been safe
in Faloo by now, and Scotland Yard would
have been none the wiser.”</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and Lechworthy
pushed forward a deck-chair. “Sit
down, won’t you?” he said.</p>

<p>“Not sorry to,” said Parget. “I’ve been
on my feet for three hours, waiting for the
chance to have a word with you. Well, as I
was saying, it was thought worth while to
look into this Exiles’ Club, if only on Sweetling’s
account. We’ve wanted Sweetling for
years and wanted him badly. He was the
Hazeley Cement swindle, as you may remember,
and the Tarlton Building Company, and a lot
more.”</p>

<p>“I do. In fact I wrote about him.”</p>

<p>“And I daresay you were pretty severe with
us for letting him get away&mdash;no matter, we
bear no malice. The public says nothing
when we hit, but it makes a lot of fuss when we
miss. Well, I was told off for this job. I’d
got Mrs Wyse’s letter. I’d only got to call
myself Pentwin, and follow her instructions,
and it was all plain sailing. And a pretty
haul I’ve made. There’s Sweetling my-lording
it over everybody; Hanson, who killed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
girl; Mast&mdash;a nasty case; Fellowes, who sold
the secret explosive; Lord Charles Baringstoke,
who forged his uncle’s name. Trimmer,
of the Cornish coal fraud&mdash;a whole lot of back
numbers nicely bound together.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well,” said Lechworthy, “it’s
all very well, but you can’t touch those men.
Faloo is independent, and has no extradition
treaty with Great Britain.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Parget, with a laugh.
“I’m not going to touch them. All I’ve got
to do is to report. I’m only a subordinate
officer at present. The rest will be for my
chiefs to settle, and if they don’t find some
way of dealing with this cock-sparrow of an
island, I’m a Dutchman.”</p>

<p>“Now to come to the point; what do you
want with me, Mr Parget?”</p>

<p>“I require you to assist an officer in the
execution of his duty. I’m in a hole. They
made all the arrangements for me to get here,
but they left it to me to get away again the
best way I could. Now if I tried for a passage
on Smith’s schooner, it wouldn’t do. I’ve
paid my subscription, and if I were Pentwin,
Faloo would be the only place for me. Why
should I want to go? They’d smell a rat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
That man Hanson isn’t any too satisfied with
me; he tried a bit of cross-examination last
night, and though I kept my end up I don’t
like it. What I’ve got to do is to disappear.
There’s been a case of that before. There was
a chap called Duncombe who got too fond of
a native girl that was already&mdash;well&mdash;appropriated.
He went out one fine night and he
didn’t come back. Everybody at the club
knows that he was killed. So I talk a deal
about the native girls up at the club. I’ve
the reputation of a Lothario. Sir John Sweetling
has given me a good dressing-down about
it already. As a matter of fact I’ve had nothing
to do with these wenches. I’ve got a
girl at home and wish I was safe back again
with her. But that’s where it is, you know.
If I go out one night, and don’t come back,
and leave all my luggage behind me, including
two or three letters to Pentwin and Pentwin’s
pocket-knife with his name and address on
it, then even Hanson will have no doubt that
I was Pentwin, and that I have been speared
or knived by a jealous man.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. But what will you do really,
Mr Parget? How does my help come in?”</p>

<p>“The night I disappear will be the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
after the <i>Snowflake</i> has come back. You’ll
send a note privately to the skipper that I
shall be coming aboard. I’ve learned to work
a native canoe all right. On the <i>Snowflake</i>
I shall lie low until you’re ready to sail.
Nobody but the King knows that I’ve spoken
with you, for at the club I’ve always professed
to be scared of going near the King’s house,
and I gather that the King has nothing more
to do with men from the club nowadays.
Besides, I fancy a word from you would keep
him quiet. And then&mdash;well, I should ask you
to lend me some clothes, take me to Tahiti,
and say nothing to anybody. I pay for what
I have, of course, and after Tahiti I can
manage for myself.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll do all that for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. And I’m sorry to
give so much trouble. The luck’s with me to
find a gentleman like you touring these islands
just now.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. But I doubt if you’ll
make as big a scoop out of it as you think.”</p>

<p>“You mean the extradition? Oh, that will
be arranged somehow.”</p>

<p>Mr Lechworthy was not thinking of extradition
at all. He was thinking that owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to his participation in the King’s scheme of a
native Faloo the exiles already had their warning,
and long before Scotland Yard had got its
gun to its shoulder the birds would have flown
far out of range. But he said nothing of this
to Parget at present; it might possibly make a
yarn for a dull evening on the <i>Snowflake</i>.</p>

<p>“Of course,” added Parget, “I needn’t
remind you, sir, that all I’ve said has been
said in confidence. Not one <span class="lock">word&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“I assure you, Mr Parget, that I have no
inclination to say a word. I shall not even
mention the matter to my niece until we are
all aboard the <i>Snowflake</i>. Your instructions
to me will be carried out absolutely.”</p>

<p>“And when does the boat get in?”</p>

<p>“The King thinks that with luck it might
be here to-morrow or the day after.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep a look-out. Thank you again, sir.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy himself escorted the little man
back to the garden entrance. Parget saw the
natives with their rifles and seemed a little
puzzled. “What does the King want all
those men up here for? Where’s the danger?
What’s he afraid of?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” said Lechworthy. “In
fact, I don’t know. But I have noticed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
King never does anything without a reason,
and it is generally a pretty good reason.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Parget, “they’re the finest
set of natives I’ve seen yet anywhere. I
shan’t be round here again. We meet on
the <i>Snowflake</i>. <i>Au revoir</i>, Mr Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Au revoir</i>,” echoed Lechworthy, mechanically.</p>

<p>There is a kind of insolence in <i>au revoir</i>, a
confidence in the future. Neither man ever
saw the other again.</p>

<p>Lechworthy wandered back to the house.
He was deep in thought. From the dark
hidden pool, where Tiva and Ioia were bathing
together, came a burst of musical laughter.
On the verandah he found Hilda, with the
wreath of white flowers that Ioia had brought
her in her dark hair; Soames Pryce stood on
the steps below looking up at her, saying something
in a low voice to which she listened with
happiness.</p>

<p>Lechworthy’s mind was preoccupied, not
only with his dream of a native Faloo, but with
this Parget, this scrap of London that met him
suddenly in the Southern Seas. He admired
the courage and resource of the man, as much
as he hated his profession&mdash;necessary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
course, lamentably necessary, but scarcely
ennobling and foreign to that way in which
Lechworthy had come to regard all sinners.
Obviously Parget had heard nothing of the
impending dissolution of the club, and Lechworthy,
who did not know that this was a
secret reserved for the committee, was rather
puzzled that Parget had not heard. On the
<i>Snowflake</i> he would expound to Parget the
scheme for a native Faloo, and his fears that
the members of the club had got to hear of it
and would now disperse. Of course Scotland
Yard might still be able to close its hand on
them&mdash;or might not. Lechworthy smiled
placidly. Those fibres of his being which had
made him a great Christian were curiously
interwoven with those other fibres which had
made him a successful man of business.</p>

<p>Not only was Lechworthy’s mind preoccupied.
There was another reason why
he could not read the story in Hilda’s eyes.
He was absolutely blind to all sex romance.
Every engagement among his wide circle of
friends and acquaintances came to him as a
surprise, though it were a foregone conclusion
to the rest of the circle. He had found many
interests in life and absorbing interests outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the realm of sex romance. Hilda, doubtless,
would be married one day, but the day was
always very vague and very far away. Hilda
had determined that her uncle was to be told
nothing at present. On the <i>Snowflake</i> she
would tell him all, and slowly win him over.
She would make him see that her happiness
was here with her lover&mdash;not in Europe without
him. At Tahiti she expected to part from her
uncle, and to remain there until the <i>Snowflake</i>
brought Pryce to her.</p>

<p>“You see, dear,” she said, “just at the
beginning of things one wants to shut out all
the rest of the world, even one’s nearest
relatives and people to whom one is devoted.
In London that can never be. If our engagement
had been the normal product of a London
season, you would have had to take me to see
people, and I should have had to take you to
see others, and it would have been all congratulations,
and interference, and horrors of
that kind. Here, thank heaven, that can be
avoided. We will avoid it.”</p>

<p>To everything Pryce agreed. “It isn’t
that I don’t know, Hilda. I do. I know I
have no right to accept such a sacrifice as you
make. I know that nobody can think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
I’ve been straight about this. It can’t be
helped. It doesn’t matter. Since last night,
down by the pool, it’s seemed to me as if since
the world began only one thing has ever
mattered. Oh, it’s too good&mdash;too good to
happen. Your uncle will insist on carrying
you off to England, and he will be right too.”</p>

<p>“He would try to do that if he were an
ordinary man with a conventional set of views.
He would not succeed, because I am of age
and in this&mdash;in this alone&mdash;I will not be controlled
at all. But he is not an ordinary man.
He is as broad in some of his views as he is
narrow in others. He has little respect for
social conventions, and he is losing some of
his respect for the law. He thinks nobody
beyond reclamation&mdash;except the ritualists and
a few politicians. He has had the courage of
his opinions all his life; whatever his convictions
have been, right or wrong, he has
always acted on them. Then, again, he trusts
me as well as he loves me. If I tell him that I
know where my happiness is, he will believe
me, and he loves me too much to refuse it.”</p>

<p>They talked a long time together that
morning. Yet still, when all was said, Pryce
was haunted by the same thought. It was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
a dream of unearthly beauty, such as before
he had never even imagined, a dream to which
the awakening must come.</p>

<p>That evening the wind fell absolutely. The
<i>Snowflake</i> would undoubtedly be delayed.
The air was hot and still, and over the pool in
the garden there hung a steamy vapour. All
living things in the island were strangely
silent. The night before the flying-foxes had
screamed and squabbled round the house.
But to-night everything was silent, as if waiting
peacefully for some event.</p>

<p>When they all came out on the verandah
after dinner, the silence seemed to oppress
them so that they spoke in lower tones than
usual. The King, as if to break the spell,
ordered Tiva and Ioia to make music, but
their song had a wild sorrow in it.</p>

<p>“What music is that, Tiva?” asked Hilda,
who sat deep in the shadow.</p>

<p>Tiva answered abstractedly in her native
tongue. The King translated, a little impatiently:
“She says that it is the music of
this night. She talks much nonsense.”</p>

<p>There were a few moments of silence and
then Lechworthy took his briar pipe from his
mouth and fired a calm point-blank question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Doctor, what was it like, living with all
those bad men at the club?”</p>

<p>“With some of them,” said Pryce, meditatively,
“one forgot that they were bad men at
all. Some were weak rotters, but I’ve found
men just as weak against whom, thanks to their
circumstances, the law had never a word to say.
I suppose the fact is that the bad are not always
bad and the good are not always good; and for
the sake of society the law has to make a distinction
which sometimes has no basis in fact.”</p>

<p>“You do not surprise me,” said Lechworthy.
“You rediscover an old truth, that we are all
sinners&mdash;God forgive us.” He sucked diligently
at his pipe for a few seconds, and resumed:
“It’s struck me sometimes that, even
from the point of view of society, a man with
habitual bad temper, or a man who drinks hard,
or a man who won’t work, or a man who gambles
with money that his family needs, may, though
the law lets him go free, do more harm than
some who have robbed or even murdered.”</p>

<p>Pryce, who had gone to bed earlier than usual
that night, had been asleep for an hour when he
was awakened by a touch on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come outside,” said the voice of King
Smith. “Quietly&mdash;as quickly as you can.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>Pryce did not wait to dress. Thrusting
his feet into a pair of slippers, he
hurried into the garden. There on the terrace
the King stood, pointing downward and seaward.
But there was no need to point.</p>

<p>Far below, amid the dark of the trees, a
giant flame leaped hungry and quivering into
the air. A column of smoke rose vertically,
the head of the column spreading out in all
directions against a grey sky; it looked like
some monstrous swaying mushroom.</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Pryce. “It’s the club.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely fifteen minutes ago; and now
look. I’m going down there directly, taking
all the men here with me.” The King spoke
in a quiet, even voice.</p>

<p>Pryce shook his head. “No good,” he said.
“You can save nobody. The men who are
not out of that place already are dead. The
whole show will be burned to the ground in less
than half-an-hour&mdash;you know how it’s built.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Wonder what started it. Some careless boozer,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>The King put one hand on his arm. “No,”
he said. “The fire started in two places at
once, at either end of the building. It has
come at last&mdash;the rising of my people.”</p>

<p>From below came faintly the sound of a
crash, and for a moment the stalk of that
swaying mushroom was spangled high with a
million sparks.</p>

<p>“I had seen signs, but I thought I held
them still. The leaders I know&mdash;three brothers&mdash;men
<span class="lock">who&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>A shrill cry came up from the dark trees by
the burning house, followed by a roar of
voices; and then, short and sharp, the bark
of the revolvers. For a moment the King lost
all his self-possession. He wrung his hands.
He flung his arms wide. “O my people, my
people!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Pryce, grimly, “your people
seem to have left you out of this bean-feast.
They’ve forgotten you, Smith.”</p>

<p>The King turned on him savagely. “And
they must be made to remember. That is
why I go. If need be, of ten men nine must
die, that the tenth may remember for ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“If that was Hanson shooting just now,
you’ll find some of the nine dead already.
But you’re taking all the patrol with you&mdash;well,
what’s left for this place?”</p>

<p>“This place is taboo. They dare not
come.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday you would have told me that
they dare not burn down the club and murder
the white men. There’s liquor in the club,
any amount of it, and you may bet your life
your precious people have looted it. They respect
the taboo when they’re sober, but they’ll
respect nothing when they’re mad with drink.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do? As it is, I have only
seventy-five men against many hundreds.”</p>

<p>“But they’re the only seventy-five who
have rifles and can use them. There’s your
own prestige too, and all the hocus-pocus and
mummery that you know how to work on
them.”</p>

<p>“I need all. I must win to-night and at
once. If I fail, the prestige is gone and we
are all dead men to-morrow. Besides, I shall
be between this house and the rebels. How
many of them will get past me? Very few.
And you shoot well, Pryce.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going to shoot any worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
I can help. But I can’t be at fifty different
points at once.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” the King admitted, “there is
a risk. And, whatever happens, I cannot
lose Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t,” said Pryce. “Valuable man,
Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Pryce. I cannot stay another
moment. I leave you six men with rifles.
You must do the best you can.”</p>

<p>Pryce shrugged his shoulders. Six were not
enough, he thought, not nearly enough. But
he could see that the King was right. Unless
the rebels were overawed and crushed at once,
all would be lost.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said. “Pick out six that
can shoot better than they can run.”</p>

<p>“You shall have six good men. You’ll
see Lechworthy and put as good a face on it
as you can. Ah, they’re bringing my horse.
Good-bye, Pryce.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye and luck to you,” said Pryce,
and turned back to the house. As he dressed,
he could hear voices in the big room at the
front of the house, and was not surprised; the
noise had been enough to waken anybody.
The sound of firing had ceased now, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
vague tumultuous roar of voices went on continuously,
mingling with the sound of the surf.</p>

<p>He was rolling a cigarette as he entered the
big room. It had struck him that white drill
might be inconveniently conspicuous and he
wore a suit of dark flannel. He carried no
weapon, and his movements were rather
slower and more leisurely than usual.</p>

<p>Tiva and Ioia cowered in a corner and wept.
Hilda, in a dressing-gown with her hair loose,
sat on the table and nursed a morocco-covered
case. Pryce knew what was in it. They had
practised shooting together. Lechworthy,
fully dressed, paced the room, his hands
locked behind him.</p>

<p>“Noisy crowd down there, ain’t they?”
said Pryce, cheerily.</p>

<p>“What on earth is happening, Pryce?”
asked Lechworthy. “It’s&mdash;it’s terrific.”</p>

<p>“Some of the natives seem to have turned
a bit unruly&mdash;started bonfires and crackers,
and little jokes of that kind. Disgraceful
behaviour. Smith has gone down with the
patrol to check their enthusiasm. They’ll all
be quiet enough presently. They’re in a
mortal funk of the King.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been out on the verandah,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Lechworthy, “and it seemed much worse
than you say. There was the sound of firing
quite undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Pryce. “Some of these
chaps are fond of loosing off their guns when
they get excited. I daresay it looked and
sounded far worse than it really is. By the way,
Hilda, I thought your medical attendant told
you to go to bed not later than half-past ten.”</p>

<p>“So I did,” said Hilda. “I&mdash;I was disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Well, this little picnic won’t last long, and
really it’s not worth sitting up for. You
ought to be in bed, you know.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think there’s any chance the
rioters will come this way?” asked Lechworthy.</p>

<p>“No,” said Pryce, boldly. “We’re taboo.
The ordinary native would sooner stand up
and be shot at than set foot inside this garden.
Besides, Smith will hold them. And if by any
chance a few should be lucky enough to get
through and mad enough to come this way,
Smith has not taken all the men; he’s left a
small army to protect this place with myself
as their general, and I wonder what funny job
I shall take on next. Come, I don’t want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
hurry anybody. But you can all sleep peacefully
in your beds, and the sooner you go to
them the sooner I can look after my chaps.”</p>

<p>Lechworthy seemed quite reassured. He
said good-night to Pryce and Hilda, and went
off, taking Hilda with him.</p>

<p>Pryce turned on Tiva and Ioia. He laughed
heartily at them. He made comic imitations
of their wailing and lament. They ceased to
weep, and became very angry. And suddenly
Dr Pryce became very serious. He spoke to
them in the native tongue. He gave them
various instructions. There were some simple
things which he wanted them to do, but they
were things that might make a good deal of
difference. They were quick to understand.
They had great faith in Dr Pryce, even if he
sometimes made them very angry. As he sent
them off, Hilda came back into the room again.</p>

<p>“What were you saying to them?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;telling them not to be silly.”</p>

<p>She clutched his arm. “I want to come
with you, dear. Let me. You know that
I can shoot.”</p>

<p>He was very gentle with her. “Yes,” he
said, as he caressed her hair, “you’re a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
shot, and this is splendid of you. Well, it will
only be waiting and watching for a long, long
time yet. And if you were there, I’m afraid I
should be watching you most of the time,
instead of&mdash;other things. Most probably
there’ll be nothing happening at all, and you’d
be up all night to no purpose, and I should feel
bad about it. But if the very worst did
happen, and one of these idiots did get past
me and up to the house, it would be a great
comfort to know that there was a revolver
there waiting for him, and waiting where he
would least expect it.”</p>

<p>He managed to persuade her that it was in
the house that she would be of the greatest
help. “I wish you could get to sleep,” he said.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I would if I could,”
she said simply. “I like to do everything you
say.”</p>

<p>“Well, lie down at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I will. You know my window. You
might come there sometimes, if you get a
chance, to tell me how things are going.”</p>

<p>“Right. I expect there’ll be nothing to
tell. Good-night, darling.” For one moment
he held her in his arms and kissed her, and then
hurried out, picking up his revolvers as he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>He found his six men waiting for him. One
of them held a torch, and Pryce made him
put it out at once. Then he stationed his men
at the different points from which they were
to keep a look-out, not far from one another,
along the hedge-crowned bank at the foot of
the garden. Of course an attack from some
other direction was quite possible, but the
place was too large and the men at his disposal
too few to keep a watch all round. It would
have been impossible, even if he had made use
of the boys who acted as house-servants, and
he had decided not to use them for this purpose
at all. They had no training and too
much temperament; they would have been
certain to see what was not there, and to make
a noise at the critical moment when silence
was essential. He kept them within the house,
where under the direction of Tiva and Ioia
they filled buckets and soaked blankets in
order that they might deal at once with any
attempt to fire the place. This being done,
Tiva and Ioia, as Pryce had directed, extinguished
every light in the house.</p>

<p>On the whole, Pryce was not ill-satisfied.
The rebels, he could see now, had lit torches;
a hundred points of light circled among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dark trees below him. If they came carrying
torches, they would be a clear mark. Also,
if they came at all, they would be mad with
liquor, and the strategy of the drunken is not
to be feared. They would take the shortest
and nearest road, and make a frontal attack
at the point where Pryce’s men kept watch.
Here between the high bank and the plantations
beyond was a broad belt clear of cover,
and there was plenty of reflected light at present;
it seemed unlikely that any party of the
rebels could get across the clearing without
being seen. Pryce was pleased, too, with the
six men that Smith had left him. They were
very keen, and they were quick to understand
what was expected of them.</p>

<p>Going off by himself to see that all was right
at the back of the house, Pryce was a little
surprised to encounter Lechworthy, wearing
his semi-clerical felt hat and calmly enjoying
his briar pipe.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Pryce. “Thought you were
in bed.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lechworthy. “You don’t
mind, do you? I said nothing just now,
because I didn’t want to make Hilda nervous,
but I should like to be in this. I can’t shoot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
but I can keep a look-out for you. My eyesight’s
good and I can do what I’m
told.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Pryce. “I’m glad to have
you. I was just thinking that I could do with
another man. Come along with me and I’ll
place you. By the way, you might knock
that pipe out. There’s a breath of wind got
up and those beggars have keen noses. You
see, my idea is that if they do come they shall
think we are quite unprepared&mdash;all in bed
and asleep, trusting to Smith and the men with
him. Gives us a better chance, eh?”</p>

<p>Lechworthy’s pipe was already back in his
pocket. “I see,” he said. “Quite sound, I
think. Is this my place?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You watch the road. Neither to
right nor to left&mdash;just the road. If they come
at all, I hope they’ll come by the road. It’ll
mean they’re being pretty careless. If you
see anything on the road, don’t shout. Move
along the bank to your left till you come to
one of the men of the patrol, and tell him; he
knows what to do. It’s rather dull work, but
don’t go to sleep; the thing one’s looking for
generally comes ten seconds after one has
stopped looking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Lechworthy. “I do not
think I shall go to sleep.”</p>

<p>The rebels constituted about three-quarters
of the native male population of Faloo. But,
as the three brothers who led them were well
aware, they were very little to be depended
on. And for this reason the leaders had not
dared to disclose the whole of their plan. The
Exiles’ Club was to be burned down, and those
who escaped from the flames were to be
slaughtered. The leaders found it expedient
to declare that no attack on the King or
the King’s property was intended, and that
although in this destruction of the white men
they would be disobeying the King’s orders,
they would really be carrying out his secret
wishes, and would readily be forgiven. The
feeling against the men of the Exiles’ Club
was immensely strong, and so far the leaders
felt confident.</p>

<p>The second part of their plan they did not
venture yet to disclose, for only in the excitement
induced by victory and by liquor looted
from the club could they hope to find followers
to take part in its execution. It was proposed
then to attack the King’s house; the
two white men there were to be killed, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
exact vengeance was to be taken on the white
woman. The King’s safety was to depend on
the terms that he would make with the rebels.
Now the taboo was a real thing to the natives,
and equally real was their loyalty to the King
and their superstitious fear of his powers;
even their hatred of the men of the Exiles’
Club would not have led them to enter upon
its attack at all, if they had known what sequel
to it was intended.</p>

<p>The first part of the plan was not well
executed, and with prompt action it is probable
that many of the members of the club
would have escaped. Had any precautions
against fire been taken, it is possible that even
the club-house, in spite of the inflammable
material used in its construction, might have
been saved. The task of firing the club-house
had been entrusted to natives who were club-servants,
and in their eagerness they started
the two fires at least an hour before the time
agreed upon, and before the cordon of armed
natives had closed round the club-grounds.
Several of the members had not yet gone to bed
and were still in the card-room; Sir John
Sweetling and Hanson were among the
number. But though the fires were discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
almost immediately, there was no fire-extinguishing
apparatus and no adequate water-supply.
The attempts made to beat out the
fire failed completely and only wasted time.
With such rapidity did the flames spread that,
although the alarm was given at once, there
were still men in the bedrooms when the sheet
of fire swept up the flimsy staircase. Most of
them made a jump from the windows and
escaped. One, a little man who had passed
by the name of Pentwin, broke his leg in his
fall and lay fainting with agony in the long
grass at the back of the house.</p>

<p>Those who had escaped wasted much time in
saving such furniture and stores as they could,
dragging it on to the lawn. And there they
stood around it stupidly, wondering what would
happen next. Half of them did not know how
the fire had originated, and did not realise that
the native rising, so long talked of, had taken
place at last. Mast knew perhaps, but he was
demented and useless. Sir John and Hanson
knew, but they were chiefly concerned in seeing
that all had escaped safely from the fire.</p>

<p>It was bright as day on the lawn. There
was a card-table, brought out just as it was,
with loose cards and used glasses on it. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
were heaps of Standard oil-tins. There were
casks of spirits and rows of bottles with gold-foil
round their necks. There was a jumble
of bent-wood chairs and lounges, with legs shot
cataleptically outwards and cushions shed
abroad. There were piles of table-linen and
full plate-baskets, mirrors in gold frames and
a mezzotint of “The Soul’s Awakening.”
Lord Charles Baringstoke went from one man
to another, displaying a small square box
of plaited grass with some exultation. “See
that?” he said. “That’s my lizard. I
saved the little beggar. He lost me half a quid
only last night, but I saved him&mdash;damn him.”
Nobody took much notice of him. Most of
them stood quite still, without word or movement,
staring at the fire as if under a spell.
Some were bare-footed and in pyjamas, just
as they had come from their beds.</p>

<p>They were equally unmoved when Mast,
his eyes blazing with insanity, climbed up on
a chair, flung his arms wide and raved. “The
judgment of God is upon us,” he shouted,
“the judgment of God! This is the day of
Tyre and Sidon. Not with hyssop but with
fire must we be made clean of our sins&mdash;this is
the commandment revealed to me. Come then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
to the baptism of fire!” He stepped down and
would have thrown himself into the burning
building, but Sir John flung him roughly to the
ground, and he lay there weeping. Sir John
had a club-list in his hand and Hanson at his
shoulder. Together they checked the list to see
if any were missing. A little distance away the
parrot jumped and fluttered on its perch, rattling
its chain furiously, drawing innumerable corks.</p>

<p>“Five not here,” said Hanson, “and all
men who slept in the house. I’ll run round
to the back to see if I can find any of them.”</p>

<p>There he found a little man with a broken
leg, moaning with pain. A canvas envelope
had jerked out of the man’s pocket as he fell.
It lay on the grass with the contents half out
of it. Amongst them was a visiting-card
printed in blue, and by the light of the fire
Hanson read it. The maimed man made a
clutch for the other papers but it was Hanson
who got them. He glanced through them
quickly, neglecting those that were written
in cypher, and then flung them into the fire.</p>

<p>“You’ve not played a bad game,” he said,
“Mr Parget of the C.I.D.”</p>

<p>Parget lay still now with closed eyes,
breathing hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“You might have won,” said Hanson, “or
again you might not, for I had my doubts
about you. Anyhow, our friends have pitched
the board over, and it can’t be played out.
I bear no malice. We can’t take you with us
with that broken leg, and I don’t like to leave
you to the natives. Better put you to sleep,
eh?”</p>

<p>Parget nodded his head twice. There was
blood on his lower lip, as he bit hard on it.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes shut,” said Hanson. He
took his revolver from his pocket and shot the
man through the head. The crash of a falling
floor drowned the sound of the shot. A volley
of sparks flew skyward.</p>

<p>Hanson rejoined Sir John. “Only one man
there, and he’s dead&mdash;Pentwin. We’d better
get together, go round to the back and make a
dash for it. We might be able to get through.”</p>

<p>A few minutes before, this might have been
done, but it was too late now. The fire had
given the signal, and the whole place was surrounded.
Before Hanson and Sir John could
get their men together, there was one loud yell
and then an answering roar of voices, as from
all sides out of the dark of the trees the natives
poured in upon the white men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the natives had antiquated firearms,
but the greater number were armed with
knives and spears. They were without discipline;
they fired almost at random, and in
consequence native killed native. Rotten
barrels burst at the first shot. But numbers
prevailed; a few revolvers could do little
against this great tide of maddened humanity.</p>

<p>Yet, with no chance for their lives, the
exiles fought desperately. Hanson, who had
dropped on one knee behind a barrel, emptied
his revolver twice and effectively before he
went down, stabbed from behind in the neck.
Sir John had already fallen, passing his weapon
as he fell to an unarmed man behind him.
Lord Charles Baringstoke was the last to go,
and for a few minutes he seemed to bear a
charmed life. He stood erect and smiling, his
eyes alert and watchful; he never wasted a
shot, and never missed a chance to reload.
Possibly for the first time in his life he had
realised his situation; certainly there was a
nobility in his bearing that none had seen there
before. His personal degradation seemed to
have slipped from him, leaving only an
ancestral inheritance of quiet and courage in
the face of death. He was quick, quick as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
light; three times he swung round rapidly
and dropped the native whose knife was
almost on him. Then all around him came
a gleam of white teeth and lean brown arms
dragging at him. He was surrounded and
went down. His smoke-grimed hands
clutched hard at the ground. “How could I
help it?” he gurgled as he died, and spoke
maybe his fitting epitaph.</p>

<p>Now torches were lit from the burning building.
The casks of liquor were set flowing, and
a dense crowd gathered round them, treading
the dead men under foot, stretching out cups
made of the half-shell of a cokernut. The
noise was terrific, and the leaders were powerless
to restrain the men who had followed
them. The three brothers stood apart and
conferred together, quarrelling violently. So
far they had won, but two of them thought
that nothing further could be done with this
disorganised mob. The youngest was for
marching immediately on the King’s house.
He had a small personal following on whom
he thought he could depend. His elder
brothers shrugged their shoulders. Of what
use would those few be against the King and
his well-armed men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not know that even as they spoke the
King was not a hundred yards away from them.
The reckless victors had kept no watch of any
kind, and the King had been able to bring his
men into the orange-grove unperceived.</p>

<p>Suddenly into the great mob that sang and
struggled round the casks on the lawn, there
poured a volley from sixty-nine rifles. The
noise of shout and song stopped abruptly;
there were moans from the wounded on the
ground and no other sound at all. Scarcely
knowing what had happened, astounded and
helpless, the survivors looked to their leaders.
But before they could speak there came a rush
of big-built men from the trees. Two of the
leaders were bound hand and foot; the third, the
youngest of the brothers, managed to escape.</p>

<p>And now the King himself rode out on to the
lawn. He worked his horse in and out through
the crowd, speaking to them as he went. If
they wished to live, he told them, they must
remain where they were. They shrank from
him in shame, turning their eyes away, like
unruly schoolboys caught by their master.
As he passed they squatted down on the earth
and watched to see what he would do. He
rode to the upper end of the lawn. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
building had burned low now; there was a
great mass of red-hot embers over the surface
of which a light flame skipped, dropping down
and bobbing up again. Here, in front of the
fire, the two leaders were brought to him.
He dismounted and looked at them long, till
they grew afraid of his eyes. Then he gave
the order and four men of the patrol took one
of the brothers, swung him rhythmically and
hurled him into the red-hot furnace.</p>

<p>With the other brother the King dealt
differently. As he looked at him, he began
to loosen the cord on the man’s wrists, speaking
softly as he did so. “See,” he said,
“what has happened to you. You can no
longer move except as I will it. There, your
hands are no longer bound; I have taken off
the cord; but one wrist clings to the other and
you cannot get them apart. Your feet also
are no longer bound, but they are stuck tight
to the earth so that you cannot raise them.
The fingers of your hands are cramped and useless&mdash;quite
useless. Here is a knife to kill me;
you cannot grasp it and it falls to the ground.”</p>

<p>The crowd watched breathlessly. They saw
the proffered knife, and their leader’s failure
to hold it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The King spoke to the man again. He told
him that he was a very fine man and a great
house should be prepared for him. “Turn
round and you will see it.”</p>

<p>The man turned, expressionless, his eyes wide
open; he stared at the pile of glowing timber.</p>

<p>“A beautiful house with many lights,” said
the King, softly, and the man’s face smiled
now in response. “They wait for you there.
You are tired, and they will spread soft mats
for you that you may sleep. Go quickly.
You must.”</p>

<p>The man ran forward, floundered for a few
steps among the red-hot embers, then threw
up his arms and fell full length. The flakes
of burning wood closed over him like a wave
of crimson sea; a gross and yellow smoke rose
where he had fallen.</p>

<p>The King mounted his horse and called
aloud. “You have seen&mdash;remember it well,
remember it well! To those who throw down
their arms and go back forthwith to their huts,
I grant their lives.”</p>

<p>Helped or driven by the men of the patrol,
they threw down their knives and spears and
slunk away down to the huts that were massed
in a straggling street on the shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>Many of the rebels had fallen to the
revolvers of the white men at bay,
and many more to the rifles of the patrol.
Two of their leaders had perished before their
eyes, and the death of one of them, slave to the
fixed eyes and whispered words of the King,
had seemed to them miraculous. How could
they have been mad enough to contend against
such a power? Spiritless and unarmed, thrust
on by the patrol with the butt of the rifle, they
staggered down the slopes to their huts on the
beach.</p>

<p>But the King knew well enough how dangerously
incomplete his victory was. The
youngest of the three brothers had got clear
away, and he had taken men with him. They
should have been followed of course, but the
King had been reluctant to spare a man until
he was certain of the main body of the rebels.
The first sign of his mistake was a cloud of
smoke rolling up from his offices and stores
on the beach below. The King thought of his
spirit-vats and galloped off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire was extinguished soon after the
King reached the spot. There were plenty
of buckets, and the beaten rebels, no longer
rebellious, worked hard to prove their return
to loyalty. They formed a line down to the
sea, and the buckets passed quickly from hand
to hand. Very little damage was done. But
the incendiary had gained all he wanted&mdash;a
certain amount of time and a clear road up to
the King’s house.</p>

<p>But the watchers up at the King’s house
also saw the cloud of smoke, and it made them
alert again, just when they had come to the
conclusion that all was well over and that the
King had won.</p>

<p>“Of course it may have been an accident,”
said Pryce to Lechworthy. “With all these
torches dodging about, there’s nothing more
likely. And the fact that it was put out so
quickly looks like that. Still, it’s just possible
that there’s somebody who’s not quite satisfied
yet. We’ll take no risks.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Lechworthy. “I’ll keep
my eye on the road. The light’s not so good
as it was.”</p>

<p>“We shall have the dawn in less than an
hour now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Pryce snatched a moment for a word with
Hilda, and went on his round of his men. On
his way back some minutes later Lechworthy
came towards him.</p>

<p>“Come and look at this, doctor. Those
lights far down the road&mdash;are they coming or
going?”</p>

<p>Pryce looked in silence for a few seconds.
“Coming,” he said. “Also the chaps appear
to be singing. You’ve done well, Lechworthy.
Now you go on to the house while we teach
them to sing a different tune.”</p>

<p>He went off along the bank. Lechworthy
did not go to the house; he stood back where
he could see what happened without being in
the way.</p>

<p>Pryce returned with his six men and placed
them. They could not be seen, and their rifles
commanded the road. They were steady and
quiet. Pryce showed them a point on the road.
When the rebels reached that point, Pryce
would give the word to fire. They seemed to
come very slowly.</p>

<p>But they neared the point at last. One man
walked before the rest, waving a torch and
singing loudly. At parts of his song the rest
broke into laughter. They came noisily, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
disorder, without precaution; evidently they
looked for an easy and certain triumph, in the
absence of the King and the patrol.</p>

<p>“Sampson,” said Pryce to the man nearest
him, “what’s that chap singing?” Pryce
could not make it out, though he knew
something of the native language.</p>

<p>The patrol man whom he had addressed as
Sampson prided himself on his English. He
translated a few phrases of the song. They
concerned the white woman at the King’s
house.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Pryce. “I’m just going to
give the word. Mark the singer, Sampson,
and let’s see if you can shoot. Fire!”</p>

<p>There were about a score of men on the road,
and four fell at the first volley; the singer
was one of the four, and Sampson smiled.
The rest stood gaping, taken utterly by
surprise. A second and a third volley followed
in quick succession. The few who were left
fled down the road in panic.</p>

<p>Sampson straightened his back and patted
his rifle. “Very good,” he said complacently.
“Dead shot. Very good.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” said Pryce, “but the
two at the end of the line spoiled the bag.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Pryce sent them off now to the back of the
house, and as he turned saw Lechworthy.
“So you meant to see the last of it after all,”
he said.</p>

<p>“But it’s terrible,” said Lechworthy,
“terrible. I’ve seen nothing like this before,
you know. One moment dancing and singing&mdash;the
next moment dead.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pryce, “we didn’t invite them.
And somebody had got to die over this game.”</p>

<p>“It’s self-defence, I know. Doctor, where
should we have been without you? We owe
everything to you.”</p>

<p>“Me?” said Pryce, cheerfully. “Why, I’ve
had my hands in my pockets all the time. I
haven’t done a blessed thing. <span class="lock">I&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>He stopped short. Far away down the
road came the sound of rifle-fire.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean, doctor?”</p>

<p>“In all probability it means that the few
who escaped from us have had the bad luck
to run into Smith and his patrol on their way
back to the house. They’ll be here in five
minutes. You might go and tell Hilda that
the show’s over.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Lechworthy. He had been
much moved. He almost resented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
flippancy with which Pryce spoke, though he
knew that this flippancy was but part of a
mask that hid something fine.</p>

<p>As Lechworthy turned away, Pryce pulled
his papers and pouch from his pocket. He
could smoke at last. He rolled a cigarette&mdash;a
cigarette that he was not destined to smoke.</p>

<p>Lechworthy was about twenty yards away
when a dark figure rose suddenly from the
bushes and made a dash at him with knife
raised. Pryce’s revolver was just in time;
the man dropped almost at Lechworthy’s feet.</p>

<p>“Run for the house,” shouted Pryce, and
at the same moment he was stabbed with two
quick thrusts in the back and in the right arm.
His revolver dropped on the ground, and he
flung himself on it. His assailant rushed on
towards Lechworthy, who still stood irresolute.</p>

<p>Pryce raised himself on his knees, taking
his revolver in his left hand, less conscious of
physical pain than of pleasure in his knowledge
that he had made left-hand shooting his
speciality. Lechworthy was in the line of fire
and he had to be very careful; it was his
second shot that brought the native down.</p>

<p>He still waited on his knees, his revolver in
his hand. He did not know in the least who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
these two men were who had appeared just
at the very moment when all danger of attack
seemed over. It did not appear that there
were more than two. He could hear his own
six men running towards him&mdash;they had heard
the sound of firing&mdash;and he could hear distinctly
on the road the sound of a horse’s hoofs
and the tramp of men. It was all right then,
and the King had returned. The warm blood
poured steadily down his right arm. Suddenly
he was conscious that Lechworthy was standing
by him. “Are you hurt, Pryce?”
Lechworthy was saying anxiously. “Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Bit of a scratch,” said Pryce. “Better
say nothing to her. Probably looks <span class="lock">worse&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>And then he collapsed, just as the King and
the patrol entered the garden.</p>

<p>It has already been said that the youngest of
the three brothers who led the rebellion had
by firing the stores and offices on the beach
gained time and a clear road to the King’s
house. He had drawn the King and the
patrol down from the point which they should
have occupied. But he started on his way up
to the King’s house with his small following
absolutely out of hand. They had triumphed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
over the white man, the King himself had
failed to lay hands on them, they had burnt
the King’s stores; and now they would burn
the King’s house, and it would all be perfectly
easy. They had drunk freely on the lawn of
the Exiles’ Club and had found more liquor
on the beach. Their leader would have had
them go up in silence, without torches, working
their way through the thick of the plantation.
But they found the road easier, and in their
intoxication insisted on treating this last advance
as a triumphant procession. Noisy
and disorderly, they never noticed that their
nominal leader had left them, taking one man
with him, and turned into the plantation by
the roadside.</p>

<p>These two men advanced parallel with the
noisy crowd, but at a long distance from them.
And when the rifle fire was drawn, and the
attention of the defenders concentrated on
the road, they took that chance to rush across
the clearing, up the bank, and through the
scant hedge into the garden. They knew the
game was up. Their one aim was to sell their
lives as dearly as might be.</p>

<p>When Pryce came to himself, he lay on his
bed. His coat, waistcoat and shirt had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
cut off. The early sunlight filtered through
the green plaited blinds. There were two dark
shadows by the bed, and the shadows slowly
became the King and Lechworthy. Pryce, a
little surprised to find himself alive, investigated
with a slow and feeble movement of his left
hand the injuries he had received. When he
spoke, his voice sounded so funny, so unlike
his voice, that he smiled.</p>

<p>“Who fixed the tourniquet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That was Hilda,” and then Lechworthy’s
voice seemed to become a dull rumble. Pryce
caught stray words: “Huddersfield ... ambulance
lectures ... Providence.”</p>

<p>And then the King was holding a glass to his
lips. Pryce smelled the brandy, and put it
aside. He asked for water, and drank eagerly.</p>

<p>“Hilda?” he said.</p>

<p>“She came out when she heard the firing so
near to the house.”</p>

<p>“All wrong,” said Pryce, feebly. “Plucky
though.” He paused awhile with his eyes
closed. Then he opened them, and his voice
seemed stronger. “There were only two,
you know&mdash;two beggars who got through?”</p>

<p>He was assured that there had been no
others. All was well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better get some sleep soon,” said Pryce.
“The jab in the back is nothing much&mdash;must
have glanced off a rib. Breathing’s pretty
easy. Bad shot of his&mdash;but he was hurried.”</p>

<p>He began to get drowsy, but roused himself.</p>

<p>“Might bring those chests of mine in here&mdash;dressings,
clips, and so on. I’ll tell you what
to do. Then we can rest.”</p>

<p>“Hilda’s getting them,” said Lechworthy.</p>

<p>There were steps outside, and Lechworthy
went out of the room. Pryce could hear low
voices outside the door. Then Lechworthy
and Hilda came in together, Lechworthy carrying
a tray of things.</p>

<p>Hilda looked towards the bed. “We’ve
changed places,” she said in a low voice.
“You’ll have to be my patient now.” Then
she went over to the window. “We shall
want more light, I think.”</p>

<p>Pryce made a quick sign with his left hand.
The King nodded and turned to Lechworthy.
“Come with me,” he said. “We can do
nothing more here for the present.”</p>

<p>A little surprised, Lechworthy looked at
Hilda. “Yes, that’s right,” she said. “If
I should want you, I’ll send; but I’ve got Tiva
and Ioia, you know, and servants besides.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to bed,” said Lechworthy
when they were outside the room. “Who
knows? I might be wanted. And I shall
sleep in a chair all right&mdash;or anywhere. I’m
done.”</p>

<p>“A chair will be good enough for me,” said
the King.</p>

<p>They sat down in the verandah in the warm
sun. Lechworthy, perhaps for the first time
in his life, filled and lit a pipe in the morning.</p>

<p>“You see it all, I suppose,” said the King.</p>

<p>“See what?”</p>

<p>“Those two&mdash;in there.”</p>

<p>“Hilda and Pryce? You don’t mean&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I do. I thought you knew.”</p>

<p>“I was a little puzzled. She was very quiet
and very&mdash;useful. But she looked&mdash;almost as
if she were going mad. Yes, I suppose it is so.”</p>

<p>“If he recovers, they marry,” said the King.
“At least you will find it very difficult to
prevent it; and he will not go to England,
you know. But he has lost very much blood.
<span class="lock">Perhaps&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Don’t say that,” said Lechworthy, sharply.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he smoked and
meditated. Then he went on: “It will have
to be as Hilda says. I daren’t interfere in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
a case&mdash;wouldn’t anyhow. If any man has
the right to her, then he has. Not a great
marriage, of course&mdash;there will be people in
London who will think she has thrown herself
away. They’ll condole, I daresay, and make
themselves unpleasant in other ways too.
But there are too many people in England who
sacrifice too much to get the good opinion of
a few others who don’t really care for them.
Are you awake?”</p>

<p>The King opened his eyes. “Awake? Oh,
yes. What was the name of that thing Miss
Auriol put on his arm?”</p>

<p>“Tourniquet.”</p>

<p>“Ah, tourniquet&mdash;new word to me. I
must remember.” And in two seconds he
was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Lechworthy watched him with a smile, and
then closed his own eyes. His pipe slipped out
of his mouth and fell on the floor beside him.
He also slept.</p>

<p>When he woke again, the King had gone and
Hilda stood on the verandah beside him.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Lechworthy. “I’ve slept
a long time, I think. How is he?”</p>

<p>“I thought he would have fainted again
when we were dressing the wounds. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
afterwards he seemed more comfortable, and
now he’s fallen asleep. He made me promise
to go and rest as soon as he was asleep&mdash;one of
the boys is waiting in the room with him, to
fetch me if I’m wanted. He’s&mdash;he’s so
sensible, you know. He tells us exactly what
to do, just as if it was some other case he was
attending. And he will thank for everything&mdash;I
wish he wouldn’t. Only, he used to be so
active&mdash;so quick, and now he can’t move
much.” There came a catch in Hilda’s voice.
“And he doesn’t seem to know, not in the
least, that’s he’s done anything much for us,
or even to think about it. He’<span class="lock">s&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>She dropped into a chair and covered her
face with her hands. For a few moments she
could not speak for sobbing. Lechworthy stood
over her, trying to soothe her.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” she wailed. “Don’t
you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Lechworthy, “I know.
And&mdash;that’ll be all right. With God’s help,
we’ll pull him through, for he’s too good to
lose, and&mdash;and that’ll be all right, dear.
You’ve been doing too much, and you mustn’t
break down now. Come and get some rest.
You promised him, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Hilda went to her room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some days later the King and Lechworthy
stood on the lawn of the Exiles’ Club. Much
money and much trouble had been expended
to make that lawn. And now it was scorched
with fire and soaked with blood, spoiled and
trampled. A few oranges on a tree that had
stood nearest to the fire were withered and
discoloured amid brown shrivelled leaves. A
long line of natives, laden with flat baskets,
passed and repassed, carrying the <i>debris</i> of the
burned house down to the shore. It was
forced labour, the punishment given them by
the King, and six men of the patrol, armed
with rifles, watched them at their work.
Other gangs had been sent out to work at road-making.
They hated the work, but they did
it submissively, lest worse should befall them.
There was not a corner of the island now in
which Hilda or Pryce, or Lechworthy might
not have walked with perfect security, unarmed,
by day or night. But Hilda would
not let Pryce do much walking yet&mdash;from his
room to the verandah, perhaps, but that was
all.</p>

<p>The King pointed to a safe, looking incon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>gruously
official among charred timbers, with
sunlight streaming on it and birds singing
around it.</p>

<p>“That must be got out,” said the King.
“If it is claimed by those who have the right,
I hand it over.”</p>

<p>“I think nothing will be claimed,” said
Lechworthy.</p>

<p>“Sir John Sweetling chose well,” said the
King, with a sweep of his arm. “Look&mdash;the
finest site on the island. Here your native
church might have stood.”</p>

<p>“It may stand there yet. I know, sir, how
much you feel my abandonment of your
scheme. It is no longer possible, but the
results which you wished to obtain by it are
still possible. Listen&mdash;in one night many
British subjects were murdered here. Remember
that, whenever you think that I could
still do as I had intended.”</p>

<p>“They were criminals.”</p>

<p>“Great Britain would not recognise the
right of your people to punish them. And
one of the men was a police-officer, sent here,
doing his duty.”</p>

<p>“But my people&mdash;think how they were
provoked into rebellion. Have they not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
punished? They have given more than a life
for a life. And those that survive are still
being punished. I have done all that I could.”</p>

<p>“That is true. The blame is not with the
responsible government of the island. Be
thankful for that; otherwise you would have
had a punitive expedition here. As it is, the
whole story must be told to Scotland Yard
and to those of my friends to whom I have
already written. I hope that I shall convince
and satisfy them, and my story will be supported
by the sworn statement which I shall
get from Pryce. I think you have nothing to
fear. But you must no longer expect protection
of the kind you wanted. At the best,
that would perhaps only have been possible
if there had been raised a strong public sentiment,
in France as well as in Great Britain,
on the depopulation question, and if the two
powers had been willing to co-operate. If this
story were told, public sentiment would be
dead against you. You may understand,
and I may understand, how all this happened,
but the public would never understand.
Your people would seem to them cruel and
bloodthirsty; your government of them would
seem unstable and impotent; they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
wish to perpetuate either. There would be
no public sympathy. If I attempted to carry
out your scheme, the only result would be that
a few travellers would turn out of their course
from curiosity to visit your island, and that
precautions would be taken, of a kind which
you would resent, to see that they came to no
harm.”</p>

<p>“My people are not cruel,” said the King.
“They are gentle, a little lazy, but good-humoured,
if the white man will leave them
alone. To-day I have more power than ever
before; I shall not be again disobeyed.”</p>

<p>“I believe that to be true,” said Lechworthy.
“But we are a cautious people, and this outbreak
is dead against you. It spoils the
record. Facts matter less than the way
people will look at them. Once one has to
explain away, one exposes a weakness and
provokes a mistrust; the chance was never
too strong, and with that weakness the chance
vanishes altogether.”</p>

<p>The King wrinkled his brows. “I do not
much understand these political affairs, but
I trust you. If you say that it is so, it is so.”</p>

<p>“You had much better trust me,” said
Lechworthy, without temper and quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
placidly. “You see, Scotland Yard has lost
a man, and it knows the route to Faloo, and it
does not let things slide. It is only my story
of what happened which can save serious
trouble for this island.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said the King, “when we discussed
this last night, I did think what might happen
if you said nothing of this&mdash;this mistake of my
people.”</p>

<p>“That is already answered. If I do not
tell, it is likely to be worse for you. Not in
any spot in the globe can the treacherous
slaughter of many British subjects be over-looked.”</p>

<p>“And yet you tell me that, though the
scheme goes, its results are still possible.”</p>

<p>“I do. And it depends principally on you.”</p>

<p>“On me? There is nothing I would not do.”</p>

<p>“You have made money, and might make
much more. You have adopted the English
language&mdash;our names and dress. You have
studied much. You could let that go?”</p>

<p>The King snapped his fingers. “Like that,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Very well. Go back to your people.
Speak their language and wear native dress.
Be a King and not a trader. Break up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
stills and empty the vats into the sea. Sell
your trading-vessels, the one link that binds
Faloo to the world outside. You tell me that
the island produces all that a native needs;
limit yourself to that. It may be that trade
of its own accord will come to you; some soap
manufacturer may try to buy your plantation
or even the entire island. Refuse him. Do
not be tempted. If chance visitors should
come here, treat them with humanity but
without hospitality; make it unlikely that they
will return. The story of the Exiles’ Club will
be known, and the island will no longer be a
refuge for the uncaught criminal. Go back to
the simplicity of your fathers and trust to the
obscurity of your kingdom, and here the race
may recover.”</p>

<p>“No communication with what you call
the world outside. No mail. No trade. You
would lose by that, Lechworthy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, never mind about that. Did
you not tell me that you had used a bad
weapon once, and that it had hurt your hand,
but that you would burn it with a little powder
and it would be clean? It has been burned
with powder. It is clean now. The chance
for the native Faloo begins to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>They talked long and earnestly on their
way back to the house together.</p>

<p>Late that evening Lechworthy found himself
alone with his niece.</p>

<p>“So it comes to an end,” he said. “To-morrow
the <i>Snowflake</i>. You’re sure he’s
strong enough for it?”</p>

<p>Hilda laughed. “If I didn’t feel sure, I
wouldn’t let him go.”</p>

<p>“And in a month&mdash;five weeks&mdash;some such
time&mdash;you will be married. And after that
when shall we meet again?”</p>

<p>“You must come out here. We’ve been
talking about that.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite likely. And perhaps, not
now but, in a few years, he will come back to
England.”</p>

<p>“He says he cannot. I&mdash;I don’t think I
should like to try to persuade him.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Possibly the suggestion
will come from him. His views may be altered
by&mdash;er&mdash;circumstances.”</p>

<p>“What circumstances?”</p>

<p>But her uncle changed the subject.</p>
